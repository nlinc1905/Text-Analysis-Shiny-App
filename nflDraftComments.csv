The list goes on."
"2015-05-01 04:38:12","NFL_Draft","greebytime",17,"My wholly uninformed reading of the 1st round


First, since I’m flaired up here – my take on the 49ers pick of **Arik Armstead** -- I hate it. Not because I don’t think he can make it, but because I don’t think they needed to take him at 17 especially with guys like Marcus Peters still there. The fact that DeVante Parker went just ONE pick before our original 15th pick slays me. Glad we got two picks for the trade-down, that’s larceny – but just unhappy that Armstead truly ended up being the guy. And Jed York tweeted it out early because he’s a douchebag weasel of a shitty owner.

Now, onto the rest.

**Picks I Loved**

**Falcons - Vic Beasley** -- perfect that they sat back and still got one of the two best pass rushers in the draft, their biggest need. 

**Browns, Danny Shelton** -- great player filling a huge need in stopping the run for the Browns. Just a logical, perfect pick.

**Texans, Kevin Johnson** -- great, clean CB and fills a need…just felt right when I heard the pick.

**Chiefs, Marcus Peters** -- man, I wanted him for the 49ers, and I think he should do well in Kansas City. Shutdown corner of the future … 

**Patriots, Malcom Brown** -- he was mocked in the top-10 occasionally and in the teens in most drafts. Not sure why he fell but the Pats had to be pinching themselves getting a guy who can play all over the line. 


  
  

**Good Picks But …**

**Raiders – Amari Cooper** -- I love this pick, and that it was Cooper over White for this team specifically, and I love that I own Derek Carr in a dynasty football league. But I am shocked that they passed on *Leonard Williams* who not only fits in perfectly but WANTED to be a Raider. I’m of the opinion that teams picking in the top-10 are doing so for a reason, and passing on the best talent isn’t smart, but Cooper is also one of the top talents in the draft himself so I can’t complain.

**Redskins, Brandon Scherff** - I get why Scherff is a great fit – but hard to believe they passed on Leonard Willams, or trading down which should have been an option. 

**Bengals, Cedric Ogbuehi** -- I thought of Cincy’s biggest need to be pass rushing and somehow, both *Bud Dupree* and *Shane Ray* were on the board. And they not only passed on that for offensive line help but took someone with a torn ACL instead of, say, D.J. Humphries who many had rated higher anyway? Just felt odd.

**Rams, Todd Gurley** -- Don’t get me wrong, he’s a stud and as a fan of the 49ers, I’m not thrilled to have to face Gurley twice a year for the future – but their offensive line is a sieve and now that is even more exposed with the focus on the running game. I have to think they’ll go OL in several of the next rounds. 

**Panthers, Shaq Thompson** -- Again, like the player though he might have been there in round 2 – but woe the offensive line. Cam Newton is going to get killed one day…like the Rams, they are now a bit predictable in how much they need OL on Friday and Saturday, which is never great.

**Ravens, Breshad Perriman** -- I am going to give Ozzie Newsome the benefit of the doubt he’s earned by being one of the very best GMs in the league. But Perriman makes me super nervous, seems like (along with…sigh…Armstead) one of the biggest potential busts in the first round. With Devin Smith out there, I would have found that much more logical.

**Colts, Phillip Dorsett** While I do like Dorsett, is this really the biggest need for the Colts? And why get a receiver so similar to T.Y. Hilton? Happy for Andrew Luck, but this one felt weird.

**Others:**  The Browns need to explain where Cam Erving plays since they have Alex Mack at C … why did the Lions trade down and receive a guard as compensation, only to draft another guard in Laken Tomlinson? Why didn’t the Dolphins stand pat with their receivers and **let my 49ers draft DeVante Parker, damnit?**

This also allows us to use Duran Harmon another S who was picked 3 years ago and has really progressed well and become a very good cover corner as well but he's basically a FS. So our S is very good and I can see them running some 3 set safety with Chung on the TE as well. Then we got Arrington, a great nickel CB and who can shut down almost any small and quick receiver although he struggles a lot against big physical receivers. Then it's Dennard a good #2, Ryan who declined last year but is a decent #3 and a good #3 and then Butler who's been very promising all year and could be another solid CB. Basically we have depth but no great player however with how great we are up front I don't think it's as big a need as G."

I'm also of the opinion that if a tackle turns out to be a good player, that's not a miss.  It takes a while for tackles to develop, but if they do eventually learn to play tackle at a high level, that's a hit from an evaluation perspective, to me.  "

**Size** ------------------------------------ 9 (Decent height, but good bulk. He can deliver a bigger blow than he takes)

**Speed/Acceleration**---------------- 9 (4.4 guy, terrific burst through the hole, once he gets outside he burns pursuit angles to a crisp. Insane speed for his bulk)

**Agility/Balance**---------------------- 9 (Again unreal change of direction ability. He can put his foot in the ground and get to the second level instantly. Very good balance after taking a hit...extremely hard to get on the ground with one guy)

**Power/tackle breaking** ----------- 10 (One of the hardest to tackle mother fuckers to come out in a while. If he’s not moving laterally and he’s coming down, hill it’s rare for him to get stoned by just one defender. His combination of strength and balance is offensive to the laws of physics)

**Zone scheme vision**---------------- 7 (Tends to peak back side and read the cut back lane first before reading the front side on zone plays and toss plays that get him moving laterally. He makes it work in college because he’s so fast/strong and defenses aren’t disciplined, but that won’t work in the NFL. That being said, when he *does* read front side and sees a fill in the hole he’s amazingly quick to stick his foot in the ground and react)

**Gap scheme vision**----------------- 9 (Much better reading straight up hat on hat blocking and power schemes. Would fit well with teams that run that style of offense like SF, STL, MIN, etc. He does try to bounce outside a bit too often at times, but it’s not an out of control habit and more often than not he makes that cut for a good reason. He always wants to get into space where he's more comfortable, but he loves lowering the boom inside as well. Unreal reaction time on seeing a fill and finding a different hole. Again, he’s better at reading north/south than he is east/west because there isn’t really a back to front read here like in zone plays. He just sees jersey color and goes)

**Pass protection**--------------------- 6 (Really not a good blocker. Tried to cut far too often, dove too early into knees rather than rolling into their hips and was batted down frequently. Doesn’t have the same pop as a blocker that he does as a ball carrier. Got run over a few times in the four games I watched. Needs to eat grass, not be on his heels, and explode into people. This will be his biggest obstacle to heavy playing time outside of knee rehab)

**Receiving** ---------------------------- 8 (Kind of a limited route tree at Georgia for RB’s but he has good hands and excellent YAC ability)

**Durability**----------------------------- 6 (Coming off an ACL. Was banged up quite a bit throughout his career with one thing or another, but he’s a tough SOB and played through a lot of it)

**Intangibles**---------------------------- 9 (Hard working kid. Was a captain for four games as a junior. Was accused of assault in a bar but it was a false accusation and all he was trying to do was give a student his hat back.

**OVERALL**------------------------------ 82 (Absurdly gifted runner. One of the best athletes in this entire class, if not THE best athlete. Has a one cut ability that tells me he could dominate in a zone scheme, but he has troublesome vision when moving laterally that will take time to develop. That being said, his vision in power and gap schemes is already really good anyway. He can start on day one on a power team provided he is healthy, which is the main knock on him for now. He will work well as a lead back, but he should have a running mate to keep him fresh and limit opportunities to be injured. UGA was always stacked in the back field and that allowed him to stay fresh and flourish as a big play threat on every carry. Other big knocks are his average to below average pass pro ability. He’ll be an early down back early in his career while he learns pass pro, which will help keep him healthy too to be honest. In a few years when he learns how to properly read lateral run plays and pick up blitzes he’ll be a monster)

My one gripe with your review (and it's something that is oft-repeated not only this year but every year) is the idea of 'could have got him at 20' or 'could have traded down.' People say things like this every year but it's impossible to prove. We have no idea where Flowers was ranked on everyone's board. St. Louis could use an offensive lineman, maybe they take him over Gurley. New Orleans ended up taking an OT, maybe they had Flowers rated slightly higher than Peat (just made up examples). It's doubtful we'll ever really know but people talk about it like it's a certainty.

Same thing with trading down. Maybe the Giants fielded some offers and the deals weren't worth it. There was a lack of trades in the first round overall, maybe nobody hit them up at all. Again people say they 'could have traded down' like teams can just check a box and find a trade partner but it doesn't work like that.

My feeling on Randall is everything he brings to the team is already here. If you want to put him all over as a versatile guy, that's Micah Hyde. If you want to put him at SS, that's Morgan Burnett. If you want to put him at FS, that's HHCD. If you want to put him at slot, that's Hayward maybe and even if you move Hayward outside, that's pretty early to take a slot CB IMO. He was a late riser, but he still wasn't rated as the top guy on most boards (although he was the top FS by some, but most even had Landon Collins above him at the more general S).

It's going to be really tough to justify the Dorsett pick when he's going to get so few opportunities to catch the ball due to the crowded receiving core.

The Colts receiving core is already already good and Andrew Luck is good enough to win games with average receivers but they've got quite a few holes on defense, holes they could have addressed with that pick. Instead they pulled a Matt Millen and spent a 1st rounder on a luxury pick while passing on several players (Malcolm Brown, Landon Collins, Eric Kendricks, Stephone Anthony, Ronald Darby) who could have been instant starters.

After drafting Laken, they have 3. Ramirez has massive playing time incentives, so he's either a $3 million starter, or a $1.4 million back-up. Either of those is pretty solid.

It turns a real problem on the Lions' roster, into a not-so problem."
"2015-05-01 08:03:06","NFL_Draft","workPRODUCTIVITY-0",3,"He meant Greco. ( who when compared throughout the league is not bad but within our line he might be 4th of 5th best lineman).

Id like to see farmer do his thing trade back in the second  maybe get another third out of it. But if there is no trade suitor- id like a wr/lb/edge/or te.

"2015-05-01 08:03:42","NFL_Draft","Xylan_Treesong",10,"&gt;  why did the Lions trade down and receive a guard as compensation, only to draft another guard in Laken Tomlinson?

One of two scenarios:

1. **Laken needs a year to develop** - I think this is least likely, but Manny is experienced, and he can at least push for the starting job. $3 million for a starting LG is not bad at all. About the going rate.
* **Laken is good to go** - This is more likely. Manny has $1.6 million in playing time incentives. That means they could have him slotted as a back-up Guard (the Lions had 2 total interior linemen on the roster before the draft) at $1.4 million. He'd be a high level backup at a position of no depth on the roster.

It makes a lot of sense, IMO."

If you have a hole on the edge and you are set at WR for instance, if you take a WR in the 1st over an edge guy how much is that really going to improve your team? I mean, the Jets took the perceived #1 player, but now they are likely to trade away a very good player because they are stacked at the position. How much did they really improve if they are plugging in a guy only to get rid of a guy they had there already that was solid? You also need to find guys that fit your scheme.

While that's true, we haven't seen much of Alshon *without* another receiver taking some pressure off of him.  He was also banged up last year and if he goes down with an injury, suddenly Royal would have been the #1.

Well for starters...

Dorsett: 5' 10"" 185 lbs.

Smith: 6' 0"" 196 lbs.

Perriman: 6' 2"" 212 lbs.

So obviously Perriman is much bigger than both those guys. He's also more physical I believe across the middle and better at catching balls up in the air. You mention Strong (who is the same height and only 5 pounds heavier) and his ability to be very physical and dominate jump balls. Perriman is no slouch in this category. 

I wasn't a fan of the pick off the back, but the more I look at Perriman and what his role will be in our offense and how he fits with our current players, it was a pretty good pick. "
"2015-05-01 14:05:34","NFL_Draft","JohnnyFire",8,"I'll get the balls to do this:

1 (33). Tennessee Titans - Randy Gregory, OLB/DE: Gregory falling into Tennessee's lap is pretty much the best thing they could've wished for, getting a QB and a top flight defensive player to boot.

2 (34). Tampa Bay Buccaneers - La'El Collins, OT/OG: There's been a paper trail linking the Bucs to liking La'El in the past. This is a perfect steal for them, and I would be absolutely gobsmacked if this pick isn't for an offensive lineman.

3 (35). Oakland Raiders - Eddie Goldman: Go with BPA on defense if you're Oakland after adding Cooper in the first.

4 (36). **TRADE** Cleveland Browns - Jaelen Strong, WR: Make my dreams come true. This would make the first two rounds an absolute dead-set success in my view. (*Browns trade 2.11 and 4.12*)

5 (37). New York Jets - Devin Smith, WR: You gotta have *somebody* to throw to.

6 (38). Washington Redskins - Landon Collins, SS: This is Washington's dream, to fall into Collins in the second round this emphatically. Makes too much sense.

7 (39). Chicago Bears - Jalen Collins, CB: Best defensive player available here.

8 (40). New York Giants - Jordan Phillips, DT: I was of the thought NY could have gone Shelton in the first, so to land Phillips here gives them two solid (albeit a bit raw) projects at DT and OT.

9 (41). St. Louis Rams - Jake Fisher, OT/OG: Fisher's son comes home! I think the Rams would've loved Scherff so they get the next best thing in my view.

10 (42). Atlanta Falcons - Tevin Coleman, RB: I think we're due to see a significant run on RB in this round, and the Falcons need to get in on it here.

11 (43). **TRADE** Jacksonville Jaguars - T.J. Clemmings, OT: Finish off the O-Line here, grab a RB next round, and Jacksonville looks ready to make the jump if Bortles shows up.

12 (44). New Orleans Saints - Maxx Williams, TE: New Orleans goes need over BPA here.

13 (45). **TRADE** Houston Texans - Dorial Green-Beckham, WR: Facing a potential firing squad for the rights to DGB's services, Houston makes the jump and gets the big bodied WR to pair with Hopkins. (*Houston trades 2nd and 5th*)

14 (46). San Francisco 49ers - Eric Kendricks, ILB: With no top flight WR in line here, San Fran gets a Borland replacement.

15 (47). Miami Dolphins - Ronald Darby, CB: Build a scary defense in Miami, even if Darby is a bit undersized.

16 (48). San Diego Chargers - Michael Bennett, DT: They got their RB in the first, but now they need someone to shore up the run-stopping on the other end. That could be Bennett.

17 (49). Kansas City Chiefs - A.J. Cann, OG: Also with no WR in line, the Chiefs grab the best pure OG left on the board and fix the interior so Charles can run wild.

18 (50). Buffalo Bills - Owamagbe Odighizuwa, DE/OLB: Not their greatest need, but the Bills aren't in a position to go QB here and Diggy is the best player left in play.

19 (51). **TRADE** Minnesota Vikings - Carl Davis, DT/DE: Basically just a BPA here for Minnesota with no other clear fits.

20 (52). Philadelphia Eagles - Ifo Ekpre-Olomu, CB: Running gags!

21 (53). Cincinnati Bengals - Preston Smith, DE: I think Cincy would be overjoyed if Goldman/Phillips/Bennett took a fall, but since they don't here, I'll say they add depth in the pass rush. 

22 (54). Detroit Lions - Grady Jarrett, DT: Lions finish off their new defensive line with Jarrett, now adding a first-ballot HOF'er in Ngata, a solid starter in Ramirez, and a building block in Jarrett.

23 (55). Arizona Cardinals - Bernardrick McKinney, ILB: I have a feeling ILB is going to fall HARD in this draft, but Arizona happily grabs him here.

24 (56). Pittsburgh Steelers - Quentin Rollins, CB: With LeBeau moving on and the offense pretty much set, Pittsburgh grabs a high-upside CB from every Steelers' fan's favorite school (Miami Ohio!)

25 (57). Carolina Panthers - Ameer Abdullah, RB: Gotta find a more effective, long term solution at RB, and Abdullah can be that.

26 (58). Baltimore Ravens - D'Joun Smith, CB: With neither Pitt nor Baltimore going CB in the first, they grab them almost back to back here.

27 (59). Denver Broncos - Ali Marpet, OG/C: Basically, open the running lanes for Ball/Anderson and get Peyton more time. Marpet is a long term project but a solid one.

28 (60). Dallas Cowboys - Duke Johnson, RB: Who else can you go with? Duke is undersized, but with that offensive line he could be an absolute stud.

29 (61). Indianapolis Colts - Marcus Hardison, DE/DT: They passed on Malcom Brown in the first, I doubt they let that happen again.

30 (62). Green Bay Packers - Denzel Perryman, ILB: After an odd CB/S conversion player call in the first, Green Bay gets their studly ILB to move Clay to a more natural role.

31 (63). Seattle Seahawks - Hronnis Grasu, C: Gotta replace Unger and fast, and Grasu is the only pure C left in play.

32 (64). New England Patriots - Eric Rowe, CB/S: Because fuck us, that's why."

The O-line is pretty spectacular, but you have Andre Smith and an aging Andrew Whitworth both entering contract years. Ogbeuhi can play both positions, as well as guard if the need arises. He gets the time to rehab this season while the two starting tackles are still good, and the Bengals love to red shirt their draft picks.

I think the only real criticism of the pick is that Ogbuehi would have likely been available later, possibly even by their pick in the second round. But the O-line coach is crazy about the kid and his technique and athleticism is incredible."

I don't think Erving can play tackle at the pro level, and I don't think he starts at guard for them over Greco and Bitonio. I don't even have a first round grade in Parker so that's why it's an F. Dupree is raw but at 22 he is a steal, going to a good staff, and a good fit for the defense. People were talking about him as high as 8 and while that's a bit early I think he's still a top 16 player in the draft. Combine that with his upside and the massive need the Steelers have at the position and to me it's an A+ selection."

Erving is probably the best value pick that you could get. A O-line that has played all 5 positions. Though, he may not be a good LT, but he could do well in the other positions.

Dupree has potential, but he most likely won't be a superior impact player this year warranting an A+ grade. This pick is a developmental first round pick by a playoff team from last year, that could have used it on a player that will play a majority of the snaps. You mentioned Erving won't play, but Dupree probably won't play a ton either.

I don't think it's a sound strategy to reach for 2nd round talent in the first round just because you have a need.  The Colts have plenty of ammo with their 8 remaining picks to go up and get a guy like Collins or Goldman or Gregory in the 2nd round, and absolutely everything would be right in the world because A) the used their 1st round pick on a 1st round talent B) they didn't reach to fill a need C) they used their 2nd round pick on 2nd round talent.

The pick of Parker is really similar to Landry's last year, Hickey knew he was gonna make over the WR corps this offseason. It was a pick for the future. Yes we now have 4 solid to good WR but Jennings will most likely be gone after his 1 season in Miami. We need cap space and his deal allows him to be cut after 1 year with no real cap hit.

So that means next year it will be Landry, Stills, Parker as the main 3. Parker is also a good fit. Dolphins had to most red zone trips of any team and were awful in the redzone. One of the worst teams in the red zone. Parker is a jump ball machine and big WR the Dolphins need. He also has a great catch radius which is something a WR needs when playing with Tannehill."

It's the nature of selecting BPA, which is what OP's post is about.  If BPA is a guy that you have rated as a 1st round talent and he falls in your lap at 29, it's not a successful strategy to pass him up for someone you have graded out as a second rounder just because you have a need.  

You'll still be able to get the guy that falls to the second round in the second round.  Sure, there's a chance that Dorsett would've fallen to the second as well, but the draft is an inexact science.  You build your board and you draft accordingly.  "

I'm a fan of just grabbing the guy who you think has the best chance of being a significant contributor, as long as it's not stupid, and I think you can make the case for the Colts that they could use another WR.

Duron Carter is a total wildcard, Dre probably isn't hanging around all that long, and Moncrief is still unproven. And if things all work out then you have a really really good young WR corps for your franchise QB

There's some value in making your strengths stronger. The best teams in this league have an identity outside the QB position (while still having that position filled, obviously) Most notably the Cowboys O-line. "

1 (65). Tampa Bay Buccaneers - Danielle Hunter, DE/OLB: Kind of a luxury pick, but now that you've added to the O-Line and QB, there should be some move on defense. This makes sense.

2 (66). Tennessee Titans - Tyler Lockett, WR: Dseals is foaming at the mouth.

3 (67). Jacksonville Jaguars - T.J. Yeldon, RB: If they don't go Coleman in the second, I can see them grabbing a downhill guy like Yeldon here.

4 (68). Oakland Raiders - Mario Edwards Jr., DE: You've added Goldman, now add his teammate in Edwards for a stout and emphatically effective D-Line.

5 (69). Washington Redskins - Paul Dawson, OLB/ILB: Redskins add a dynamic LB to try and fill some of the space that was once filled by Orkapo.

6 (70). New York Jets - Garrett Grayson, QB: Someone was eventually going to bite. That ends up being New York.

7 (71). Chicago Bears - Gabe Wright, DT: Best DT on the board and a guy some think could work as a 3 down player.

8 (72). St. Louis Rams - Sammie Coates, WR: Rams keep adding skill position players with upside.

9 (73). Atlanta Falcons - P.J. Williams, CB: Falcons I think can still grab a CB this late in the same, and Williams, despite being a dumbass, is a steal in the third.

10 (74). New York Giants - Devin Funchess, WR/TE: Rather than use Funchess as a pure TE, Giants can slot him in at WR2 to take the middle of the field when defenders turn to ODB (or Cruz?)

11 (75). New Orleans Saints - Nate Orchard, OLB/DE: Two picks before my dreams can come true nabbing Orchard this late in the game, the Saints grab him adding a gamer to the LB corps.

12 (76). Minnesota Vikings - Mitch Morse, OG/C: Some wanted La'El in the first before his fall, so they get an interior lineman here.

13 (77). Cleveland Browns - Ha'uoli Kikaha, OLB/DE: Cleveland get's the Washington Polynesian DOUBLE COMBO. Someone get me a Mai Tai, damnit!

14 (78). New Orleans Saints (from Miami Dolphins) - Bryce Petty, QB: It's known that the Saints like Petty. With a bonus third, I don't see him making it past them here.

15 (79). San Francisco 49ers - Rashad Greene, WR: Missing on a WR in the first two rounds, San Fran grabs one here...albeit one with a little less size.

16 (80). Kansas City Chiefs - Derron Smith, FS: I hate to say you need a safety valve at safety if you're KC right now, but you really kind of do.

17 (81). Buffalo Bills - Brett Hundley, QB: And the second tier all goes in the second. Really hard to pass up Hundley at this point for Buffalo with their QB needs in the long term.

18 (82). Houston Texans - Lorenzo Mauldin, OLB/DE: Best fit available for what they need here.

19 (83). San Diego Chargers - Tre Jackson, OG: Gotta have someone open the holes for Gordon.

20 (84). Philadelphia Eagles - Donavon Smith, OT: A righteous steal for Chip Kelly to start getting a line worthy of Murray.

21 (85). Cincinnati Bengals - Xavier Cooper, DE/DT: And now Cincinnati adds it's DT. This locks up that defense from Top 5 to maybe Top 2 in terms of scary-as-fuck quotien.

22 (86). Arizona Cardinals - Daryl Williams, OT: Gotta keep Carson Palmer off his ass.

23 (87). Pittsburgh Steelers - Trey Flowers, DE: Pittsburgh doubles up on the pass rush.

24 (88). Detroit Lions - Kwon Alexander, OLB: Basically just running with the best OLB in play.

25 (89). Carolina Panthers - Rob Havenstein, OT: Now for someone to help Abdullah run that damn ball.

26 (90). Baltimore Ravens - Tyeler Davidson, DE/DT - A very typical move for the Ravens to get a high-upside replacement for Ngata.

27 (91). Dallas Cowboys - Henry Anderson, DE: Dallas is going to be leveraging for a DT in this round I would venture to bet.

28 (92). Denver Broncos - Clive Walford, TE: Walford is the best remaining TE prospect on the board, and Denver needs to replace Orange Julius; they've shown character isn't a concern, so they will try to reign in what Walford can bring.

29 (93). Indianapolis Colts - Jaquiski Tartt, SS: Missing on Collins not once but twice, Colts get a man at strong safety here.

30 (94). Green Bay Packers - Jeff Heuerman, TE: The Pack takes a much safer approach and takes a high character, big bodied TE who may lack the pizazz of Walford or Williams, but makes sense to give them a needed position.

31 (95). Seattle Seahawks - Chris Conley, WR: Jimmy Graham is not enough if you want this team to be a well-rounded machine of destruction.

32 (96). New England Patriots - Frank Clark, DE: Of course they get Clark too. Of course they do. Who else the Patriots gonna get, a high upside RB?

33 (97). New England Patriots (compensatory selection) - Jeremy Langford, RB: Goddamnit.

34 (98). Kansas City Chiefs (compensatory selection) - Justin Hardy, WR: He fits for this scheme just way too well. They don't need a safety valve, they need a solid slot guy who can do what Smith needs.

35 (99). Cincinnati Bengals (compensatory selection) - Doran Grant, CB: Luxury pick to take an Ohio State favorite and just add to the secondary even more."

As Goodell descends from his box to deliver the suspension papers, Polamalu times the snap perfectly, vaults over the cadre of lawyers providing a pocket for the commissioner and sacks him.

###DeAndre ""Helter"" Smelter (WR, GA Tech)

6'2"", 226 lbs

32 5'8"" arms, 11"" hands

unable to run at Combine or Pro Day (torn ACL)

Games watched:

- vs Clemson

- vs Virginia

- vs VA Tech

- vs Georgia

- vs Miami

- vs Georgia Southern

- vs Wofford

---

Before the tape breakdown, I should preface this. I've been in love with Smelter since I arbitrarily scouted GA Tech vs Clemson back in November. Since then, I've basically been pimping him out anywhere and everywhere I can. If it wasn't for that pesky torn ACL, I think he could've been a second-round receiver in this class. I'm praying the Raiders pick him up in the 4th/5th to pair with Amari Cooper long-term.

(side note: there probably aren't gonna be a ton of GIFs this week because I can already tell DB sucks right now with everyone looking at their first-round picks today)

---

**Runblocking:**

This is normally a bit of a footnote when it comes to receivers, but GA Tech is unique in that this aspect of their receivers is often top-notch. Smelter is the best runblocking WR in this class, and quite frankly, I don't think it's even close. While I normally just like to see a receiver getting in the way and maybe show some good form to stack up the CB/LB, Smelter plays like a TE in a RB's body and is actively looking to destroy people in the running game. You can turn on any tape where Smelter is playing and it will be the first thing you notice about him; for example, [here's two random snaps from the GA Southern game](http://www.draftbreakdown.com/gif-embed/?clip=258323&amp;gif=SpiffyIllinformedAmericanblackvulture
).  If I had time, I'd go through and give dozens of examples of why Smelter is a fantastic runblocker, but just know that the gif I linked is the effort that shows up on tape every single down.

He is absolutely *ruthless* when mowing down people for his teammates, and that kind of selfless play shows up time and time again. I wish I could get a gif for this one too, but DB doesn't have his Miami game up. There was a snap from the Miami game where Smelter looked like he could've broken upfield and scored a TD on a route, but quickly noticed that his QB was planning on running. Right as the DB broke to defend the deep ball, Smelter locks on and absolutely destroys him runblocking, blocking Gunter on a 26-yd read-option run. I just really can't hype up his selflessness enough.

**Hands:**

None of this really matters if you're just gonna be the next Stephen Hill though. You can't be a big-bodied receiver that just can't catch and survive in the NFL. While this moniker does apply to the other GA Tech receiver in this class, Smelter is likely the most sure-handed receiver to come out of Tech since Demaryius Thomas. While Smelter was unable to run at the Combine, he was able to do measurements, and his 11"" hands were tops of all receivers. He regularly bailed Justin Thomas out of some questionably-placed balls and showcased a fantastic catch radius and an ability to pluck the ball from a variety of tough catch points. [Here](http://www.draftbreakdown.com/gif-embed/?clip=258323&amp;gif=AllPresentAlaskankleekai), you can see him stack/shed a DB, highpoint and pluck the ball out of the air effortlessly, and spin ahead for the first down. This was a 3rd-and-23 that he made look as easy as converting a 3rd-and-3. I think I charted him with one dropped target across the seven games I scouted. While his stats aren't mindblowing, he is a guy that just absolutely comes through when needed most.

**YAC:**

I threw out the comparison to Thomas earlier, and the main reason I feel this way is because Smelter is surprisingly a monster after the catch. He doesn't have the blazing speed of Perriman or Dorsett, but he does have [a brutal stiffarm](http://www.draftbreakdown.com/gif-embed/?clip=258323&amp;gif=WickedEveryCollardlizard) to pair with some [ridiculous power and field vision](http://www.draftbreakdown.com/gif-embed/?clip=258321&amp;gif=EachBigArabianhorse) to score/get chunk yardage from anywhere. Again, he isn't a burner, especially compared to the talent in this class, but his YAC skills are stiil top-notch, especially for a guy who isn't necessarily known for that.

**Route-running:**

A drawback with a lot of Tech receivers is that they aren't super developed route-runners, but Smelter shows enough from what I've seen that I'm comfortable with him. He isn't Amari Cooper or anything, but for only playing football for two years, Smelter is probably farther along as a route runner than some of the other top receivers in this class (like another draft crush of mine, Kevin White). He sells his routes and his runblocking together, like I alluded to earlier with his Miami runblock, and he is pretty sharp on the routes he's asked to run. He obviously has work to do cleaning up his routes and expanding his route tree and so on, but I don't think he is a liability like this at all.

**Special Teams:**

I actually didn't know Smelter played STs until watching the Wofford tape, but he showed some pretty nice moves as a PR and gunner. Given his propensity to knock the shit out of everyone his YAC skills, and his tendency to fall forward for extra yards on every snap, these roles make perfect sense for him. I actually think that he may start off as a really good PR in the league.

If Smelter falls to day three, whoever gets him may get the steal of the draft. I'm just gonna go all out with my love for this dude. Please get and stay healthy, Smelter."

"2015-05-01 15:36:27","NFL_Draft","JeezusChristIII",3,"This proves to me that the most accurate draft come from when the college season is wrapping up. There are of course some players that jump up (Kevin White, Vic Beasley) who werent always considered top 10 talent and some that drop (Gregory, Ray).

"2015-05-01 15:37:21","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"Parker definitely does some things well. He is just insane after the catch and he has excellent hands.

"2015-05-01 15:37:25","NFL_Draft","JohnnyFire",3,"Here was my last mock:

**1. Buccaneers - Jameis Winston, QB** - Correct.

2. Titans - Leonard Williams, DE/DT - Failure. I thought the ""Mariota falling"" narrative was far sexier. Ah well. Oddly, Tennessee and New York switched players here at the same spots.

3. Jaguars - Vic Beasley, OLB - Close! Went Fowler, which I should've called.

**4. Raiders - Amari Cooper, WR** - Correct.

5. Redskins - Dante Fowler, OLB/DE - Not even in the justifiable ballpark here. Scherff was a good pick but way out of left by what most people thought.

6. Jets - Marcus Mariota, QB - Wrong. Went the wrong narrative. Jets got a steal in Williams though.

7. Bears - Shane Ray, DE/OLB - GAAAAH. I really thought Ray was going to stay in action this high, but picked right before the weed bust.

8. Falcons - Alvin Dupree, DE/OLB - Right position, wrong player, and Dupree then fell like seven miles to the earth.

9. Giants - Kevin White - Nope.

10. Rams - Brandon Scherff, OT/OG - Not even close.

11. Vikings - La'El Collins, OG/OT - So much nope.

**12. Browns - Danny Shelton, DT** - Correct.

13. Saints - Randy Gregory, OLB/DE - LOL not even in the first round.

14. Dolphins - Trae Waynes, CB - Noperino.

**15. Niners - Arik Armstead, DT/DE** - I'm calling this one correct. Right player, wrong spot. The paper trail don't lie.

16. Texans - Devante Parker, WR - Nizope.

17. Chargers - Malcom Brown, DT - Nopeapalooza.

18. Chiefs - Cameron Erving, OT/C - Neeerrrrrrrp.

19. Browns -Ereck Flowers, OT - Nope, but I was correct on the OT call.

20. Eagles - Byron Jones, CB - That looks like a nope, Cotton.

21. Bengals - Eddie Goldman, DT - Again, not even in the first round, derp to me.

22. Steelers - Owamagbe Odighizuwa, DE/OLB - Position right. Had to take Dupree tho.

23. Lions - Andrus Peat, OT - They did go O-Line, but yeah, no.

24. Cardinals - ~~Brett Hundley, QB~~ Eric Kendricks, ILB/OLB - I'd have been better off with my running joke.

25. Panthers - D.J. Humphries, OT - Nopealope.

26. Ravens - Marcus Peters, CB - Niddlynope.

27. Cowboys - Todd Gurley, RB - Nopeapotamous.

Jordan Phillips plays the same position at Jonathan Hankins, an absolute stud for us last year. Behind Hankins is Kenrick Ellis, a run stuffing 1-tech/Nose. Those guys aren't 3-techs and neither is Phillips. I don't mind that he's raw, we coach up our DTs exceedingly well, he just doesn't have a role on our defense. 

Devin Funchess is trash. He's not athletic enough to be an outside receiver IMO. Rueben Randle and a healthy Victor Cruz are both way better. Hell, Larry Donnell is a better TE than he is too.

Drafting some project LT most definitely doesn't fix the problem, especially if there is a better prospect that can have an immediate impact tomorrow.

Why would we reach down for a 2-3rd round talent with our 1st round selection if this was the case? Also...this surprised no-one who follows the Panthers closely. The beat writer for the Panthers on ESPN was one of the only people who refrained from mocking an OT to the Panthers in the first round because he knows that our GM doesn't reach down and always selects BPA.

Last year everyone was puzzled when we selected Kony 2012 in the second round because we were so deep at edge rusher...but low and behold the Greg Hardy fiasco happened and that pick actually helped more than any could have anticipated. We have a dynamic LB with three ACL injuries who is 34 years old and a SS who is also in the twilight of his career. This pick made a lot of sense."

So, in a perfect world they could have traded out of the 1st and gotten a high 2nd round pick to take (for example) Clemmings or Jake Fisher or Donovan Smith, and then grab Thompson later (or flip that). Maybe there wasn't a trade market, so again I wouldn't reach ... but my only point is that if the Panthers also barely draft for OL help this year that it's terrifying for Cam Newton and anyone who roots for him.

"2015-05-01 17:28:59","NFL_Draft","woodchips24",1,"Alright fine. Then who do you sit in that case? Kam or Thomas? Or did you just waste your pick on a bench guy"
"2015-05-01 17:29:08","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",2,"To me the best players on the board are:

1. Jaelen Strong- I am not even going into this, everyone already knows how I feel on him.

2. Denzel Perryman- In my opinion a stud inside linebacker. Violent downhill hitter, excellent tackler, and not as bad in coverage as he is made out to be. Also has that IT factor.

3. La'el Collins- Obviously this an awful situation for Collins, but if innocent he is a steal in the second.

4. Eddie Goldman- Big hoss in the middle and a good value early in round two.

5. Lorenzo Mauldin- I;m higher on him than most but I think he is going be be a very good player somewhere. Already very polished with powerful hands.

6. Owa Odighizuwa- Diggy has hip issues, but without those he is a top 20 pick who is an excellent run defender with the athleticism to turn into an equally great pass rusher.

6. Landon Collins- Collins is a limited box safety, but he is very good at that. He will thrive in the right system.

7. Randy Gregory- Off the field issues seem to have really scared teams. However, in the second his talent will probably be too much to pass up.

8. Maxx Williams- Williams isn't a freak athlete, but he is still a solid one with great hands and solid blocking ability. He will be a quality player even if he never reaches Pro Bowl caliber.

9. Eric Kendricks- Kendricks is an athletic coverage linebacker with solid skills to round him out. He shouldn't last long.

10. Ronald Darby- Very athletic corner who isn't a true ballhawk, but it doesn't matter if you can't beat him."
"2015-05-01 17:30:11","NFL_Draft","greebytime",1,"&gt; Why would we reach down for a 2-3rd round talent with our 1st round selection if this was the case?

I mean, for what it's worth, that's what many thought Shaq Thompson was. I don't mind when teams draft guys they like regardless of round -- but if I rooted for the Panthers, I'd remain very concerned about that OL and would assume/hope/pray that the team isn't content with what they currently have. That's all.

Drafting great players is always smart - folks thought Carlos Hyde and Chris Borland were luxury picks last year - and had Borland not suddenly retired, they'd both be starters for the team today."

"2015-05-01 17:33:08","NFL_Draft","woodchips24",1,"We should be trying to keep Mo, since he is better than Williams. Right now Mo is a proven elite talent, and Williams is an unknown. You don't let Elite talent walk out the door to replace it with an unknown"

One interesting thing of note. I've seen the criticism they are laying on Thompson as a ""tweener"" being compared to what was said when the Buccaneers selected Lavonte David. I'm sure the Bucs have no regrets about that decision."

There may not be a more stacked position on any team in the NFL than RB for the Eagles. If Gurley was somehow still available at the Eagles 2nd round pick? Nope. Not taking him. Not in the 2nd, 3rd, 6th ... simply not going to draft a RB.

Chip said in one of his pre-draft pressers that he liked the WR depth and prided himself on finding gems at the position in late rounds.

They also don't NEED Armstead, which is why so many folks said that.

"2015-05-01 19:22:31","NFL_Draft","EonKayoh",7,"I was grading the draft as it went and I gave seven (7) A+ grades.

1. Jameis Winston to the Bucs.  He's going to revive this franchise and make them relevant again.
2. Todd Gurley to the Rams.  They have very few true needs on their roster, so bringing Gurley in to essentially protect the rest of the team by grinding down defenses &amp; keeping their own defense off the field makes a ton of sense.  This makes Greg Robinson from last year an even better pick since he's such a dominant run blocker.
3. Devante Parker to the Dolphins.  Phenomenal value here, I've got Parker in my top 10 and didn't see him dropping past the Vikings at 11.  The Dolphins got /u/barian_fostate 's best WR in this class and a guy I consider to be tied for 2nd best with Kevin White, behind Cooper.
4. Bud Dupree to the Steelers.  This is the exact opposite of the Jarvis Jones pick - a raw athlete who they can coach up to be an elite pass rusher.  Jones failed because of his subpar athleticism, Pittsburgh got a great value here &amp; avoided making the same mistake twice.
5. Shaq Thompson to the Panthers.  This is the ideal situation for Shaq and the Panthers might have the most athletic LB corps in the NFL right now.  Davis at Sam, Kuechly at Mike, Thompson at Will.  The way the Panthers use their linebackers - the gigantic zones they're expected to cover - makes this pick absolutely perfect &amp; will make Carolina's secondary look even better.
6. Breshad Perriman to the Ravens.  They're replacing Torrey Smith with Torrey Smith on steroids.  They're stretching the field just as much as they did with Torrey Smith, but with a guy who's got far more upside than Smith.  Remember, Smith was a hair under 6'1 and had 4.44 speed.  Perriman is 6'2 and has 4.25 speed.  Huge upgrade and Flacco will be ecstatic.
7. Byron Jones to the Cowboys.  I don't care if they use him at CB or FS, he's a top 10 talent and this was the best value pick of the entire first round.  Yes, even better value than Dupree to the Steelers.  Elite athletes like Jones are once in a lifetime type players, and the Cowboys got him at 27th overall.  True steal."

I think your grade for the 49ers is harsh. I judge that by the analysis. You said Armstead has a ton of upside and that he fits a need. I'd add in that he's a trench guy which makes it even more acceptable. It seems your entire D- grade was based on value, but your perceived value of Armstead may be way off.

If we look around at how people valued Armstead, he was all over the place. Scouts, Inc. had Arik Armstead #12 on the Big Board. They had him as high as #7 at one point. Mel Kiper had Armstead #15 on the Big Board. Daniel Jeremiah and Mike Mayock both had him #14 I believe. I did see him lower on the big boards of a bunch of smaller draft guys, but overall, I think there are enough main draft evaluators that had Armstead ranked highly that it's tough to say this is a big reach.

The issue for me was that every team had so many options because all of the players were so equal due to the lack of talent in this Draft, and so it was really hard to get surprised by anything. I didn't know what was going to happen but I wasn't surprised, either. Then you add in the lack of trades and that was less exciting, but I think the lack of trades this year adds suspense for next year. We know that we don't have to have 5-7 trades every year in the 1st round. We can still only have 1-2. I like that.

Jarius Wright is a good slot guy that is an ok #3 but is great for a #4
Cordarrelle Patterson still has all the potential in the world, and even if he doesn't develop much more is still worth being a #3/#4 WR due to his return/running-after-the-catch abilities

Maybe you disagree, but I've actually been impressed with Wallace's ability on shorter routes in addition to his deep threat. Assuming Johnson and/or Patterson continue to develop and Wallace stays constant, that's a deep and dangerous WR corps, even if it doesn't have a true #1.

With that being said, I almost guarantee they grab another back in the late rounds - just wasn't worth reaching with a guy like Beasley on the board.

For 90% of Falcon fans, getting Beasley or Fowler was the the ideal scenario.

Philips will never be anything other than a big body, and the same way that the other guys will never be anything else than situational pass rushers. Brown is at least well rounded with a great combination of size and speed that the others just can't bring. None of them are at the moment either physically or mentally the player that brown is simply because of how he can be changed around. Bill takes versatility as highly important, and someone who can be above average at each need for each position is perfect"
"2015-05-01 22:53:42","NFL_Draft","mpejkrm",6,"I also strongly disagree that we would have taken Gurley at 3 if he was healthy. This is a deep RB draft and we needed a LEO"
"2015-05-01 22:55:08","NFL_Draft","JHMRS",1,"That's what I meant by future need. Teams do it all the time. GB did it with Rodgers.

But it's one thing to draft with 2-3 years in the future in mind, when your QB is 36 years old. It's another to take a QB in the first round when you have a 25 year old Andrew Luck at the helm. It's a wasted pick.

But, by strickly BPA, if he's the best rated player, you take it.

Erving is interesting. First of all, a lot of teams project him as a guard, and not just as a center. Randall, in GB, is going to play CB, even though he played FS at ASU. Even with Bitonio at guard, his counterpart, Greco, is subpar IMO. So there's the need there.

And even if he's supposed to play Center, Mack has just had a season-ending leg injury. Maybe management isn't confident that he can come back and perform. There's also the issue of him being able to void his contract at the end of the year, meaning the Browns will have to compete for him in FA. So there's chance that he's gone after this year.

Erving is a need. An immediate need if they consider him a G, and a near future need/insurance in light of Mack's injury and contract. 

Maybe not the most pressing need, but a need nonetheless. And I think this is the source of the confusion. By BPA, teams mean the Best Player Avaliable who fits a need, without arranging players depending on which need is the most pressing. With Need, they absolutely put more value on players that fit more pressing need.

But it's not as simple as that. There are teams that have philosophies involving value of players based on position, for instance. The Patriots simply don't draft WRs in the first round.

BPA vs Need is simplistic. But the notion that a team goes strickly BPA is not true."

Jaguars added the best pass rusher and sold a lot of tickets to UF fans.

The Dri Archer pick annoyed me last year but at least I could see the logic behind it (fills a need at KR, has deep speed on a team that at the time didn't have a deep threat) but i'm at a loss here. I guess the 3rd round is the new round for questionable skill position picks? Coates will be the 4th receiver on the team at best next season and even if the team plans to let Wheaton walk when his contract expires Coates isn't a replacement for him because he doesn't have slot receiver quickness or trustworthy hands.

I absolutely love Walford in the third. I don't trust any TE on our team but Rivera, and he isn't much of a runblocker. This lets us play  sets with Cooper/Streater/Crabtree at WR and Walford/Rivera at TE, which is about 100000% better than what we had last year.

"2015-05-02 06:02:18","NFL_Draft","enfyte416",11,"Honestly I think it's partially the injury and partially because he just didn't have a great combine and senior bowl. He was touted for having great athleticism and didn't measure up to that when you really look at the numbers. 

A lot of prospects really stole the news headlines, so what I am assuming is that he had really poor drills at the combine/senior bowl and it just wasn't documented well. Literally just guessing but I don't think a foot fracture with a 6 week recovery time could really drop him that much. "
"2015-05-02 06:05:16","NFL_Draft","noseonarug17",3,"Zenner might be Albino Rhino 2.0 (although he's not that pale) - I don't think he'll ever start, but he could be an awesome backup or change of pace back."

"2015-05-02 06:09:08","NFL_Draft","nootfloosh",2,"Special teams was the main focus. Randall and Rollins will add competition in the secondary for sure, but they also will play a big part on coverage teams and return units - guaranteed. And Montgomery is a dynamic receiver coming off a down year, but he will greatly improve our return specialist role.

There are still enough ILB's in this draft with a chance to compete on defense this year, but clearly the Packers either believe in the talent already on the roster or really didn't value those players over the ones we chose instead.

In all matters of the draft I will defer to the guy who gets paid to make those calls. He's got a pretty good track record of it so far. Why be upset? I'm excited that we are adding more talent to the roster overall, regardless of position."
"2015-05-02 06:09:18","NFL_Draft","kclineman",2,"Safe to say I had Morse undervalued which is kinda embarrassing since I've seen every game he's played. We reached a bit but he can play 4 O-line spots."

I love the Kikaha pick. We actually took him in one of the mocks here at 44. He's a great pass rusher, and he can also play some Sam. 

Grayson....eh, I'm ambivalent. I certainly don't love the pick, and I don't really like it; but I don't dislike it. I don't know that I see him developing into Brees's replacement; but if Payton sees it, I can tolerate the pick. They certainly know more about it than I do. 

P.J. Williams I'm okay with. Would've preferred Carl Davis, but CB is cool. Williams had borderline first round talent, and they took him in the middle of round 3. The red flags are concerning; but you can take a risk with your fifth pick of the draft, especially when it's not at a huge need.

If he misses any sort of significant time because of said injury it really sets him back even more than most rookies. A guy who has only been playing OL for 2 years misses out on his rookie camp? Does he start on the PUP? Could be a long time before you see a return on your investment."

My least favorite (actually my favorite because I'm a Texans fan) is the Colts. They draft a pretty good WR in round one when I would call that one of their stronger positions, even after considering Andre is getting up there in age. If they wanted to be all offence and no defence they could have at least gotten a line so Luck would be safe and just throw all over teams.

- **Bears** - Kevin White has the chance to be every bit as good as Alshon Jeffery, so Chicago has a potentially elite 1-2 punch. Goldman's flexibility will be invaluable to a team switching to a 3-4. Hroniss Grasu is an exceptional value and immediate replacement for Roberto Garza and Brian De La Puente.

Worst: 

- **Rams** - I've never been an advocate of making drastic reaches for scheme fits. I don't care that Havenstein and Brown are two of the better run blocking OL in the draft. Each could have been had at least a round later. Don't even get me started on us taking Mannion over guys with actual physical upside.

I'm starting to think Matthews is staying inside considering he flourished there last season. If that's true, our front 7 should be better than it was with the return of Raji to NT. The WR was fine value, but my issue is that he's probably being used mainly for ST, which was a much bigger concern than our defense but still early for a KR.

I'm not sure why everyone assumed all offseason that ILB was our only issue when Tramon and House both left us with a big need in the secondary. "

I personally had a second-round grade on Walford and actually mocked him to us once or twice in the third round early on. He is already a more complete TE than Rivera, pushing him down to a much-more-accurate TE2, and makes for an interesting TE3 battle between Lee Smith, Brian Leonhardt, and 2013 6th round pick Nick Kasa at blocking TE. Given how fucked we were at the position, I'm okay with finishing off that position for the foreseeable future.

I'm less thrilled about Edwards, especially since I had a third-round grade and was higher on him than many, but I still like the fit. I think he compares favorably to Lamarr Houston, who we never really replaced. I heard some whispers that Mario was one of those guys that might've had more NFL hype than media hype, and if we are taking a chance on a big DE, I don't mind it being a guy with high potential and connections to our coaching staff.

I admit day 3 was a lot of names I wouldn't have linked to us, but two offensive starters and a very likely defensive starter in Edwards is a good haul regardless. I'm optimistic with the project players taken in the later rounds because McKenzie has found a lot of talent there in recent years that have actually developed into okay starters for us (Murray, Rivera, Streater, and TJ Carrie were all after the sixth round), but three starters in the meantime still seems noteworthy imo."

"2015-05-03 02:41:10","NFL_Draft","JohnnyFire",6,"I'll have some *balls*:

Please note: I'm *rrrreaaallly* guessing on the results here.

1. Washington Redskins - Joey Bosa, LB: I think Bosa is pretty much going to be consensus #1 guy if he comes out this year. The Redskins aren't going to be damned by RGIII's play, more that they have a lot of things that are still in the process of coming together. Bosa makes the most sense here, since RGIII's option was picked up and I don't see a taker anywhere. Bosa transforms Washington's D to a tremendous degree.

2. Buccaneers - Ronnie Stanley, OT: Despite spending two picks on OT, I can see the Bucs still damned by having a rough schedule and a weak O-Line that will not immediately include Ali Marpet. Stanley, imo, is the premier OT coming out next year and would've been a first rounder this year. With Marpet stepping in next year as a G, Smith becoming a pure RT, and Stanley as a pure LT, Winston suddenly has a chance.

3. Bears - Connor Cook, QB: Despite a very, very solid draft from Chicago in my view, bad news Bears fans; the rest of the NFC North still looks damn good. That said, as much as the Bears could stand to move away from Cutler. There will be a few ways to go here, but I'm gonna say Cook for the Bears.

4. Raiders - Leonard Floyd, LB: Lots of hype on Floyd. This should round out Oakland's defense and help them make a big jump forward.

5. Titans - Shawn Oakman, DE: Oakman is essentially the goddamned Hulk. I'll let you google him yourself. Unlike someone like Armstead, Oakman is an elite athlete with insane potential if you can coach him up. He could be a high-level slam dunk.

6. Browns - Christian Hackenberg, QB: Cleveland has a tough schedule, and I still have doubts about Johnny Manziel. I also have severe doubts about Cardale Jones meeting his hype this year; Hackenberg is still a prototype pro-style QB, and don't forget, many thought he would reach Andrew Luck level hype. He should come out of the draft as a top QB prospect.

7. Niners - Duke Williams, WR: All Niners fans die of joy taking a skill player high.

8. Jaguars - Spencer Drango, OT: I like Drango quite a bit; one of the few things Jacksonville could still use is someone to fill out the offensive line. I think he'll earn a high spot here.

9. Chiefs - Shilque Calhoun, DE: I would've loved Shilque this year, really don't hope his stock doesn't fall; I think KC and the below Bills would love to trade down to take a more sensible QB choice, but I'll pick Calhoun here as an elite fill in if the Houston situation goes to shit.

10. Bills - Dak Prescott, QB: Assuming that Cardale doesn't meet his hype, Dak and Kessler will probably be battling for the magic 2-3 spot. Prescott does do some things very well and dear god do the Bills need a QB, quite literally a QB away from turning the corner."

Defensively: I LOVE Bosa. He's my favorite player in the draft. Oakman should be even better with another year of college ball. Scooby is awesome.

1) Armstead: he needs to develop before he is anywhere near ready

2) Tarrt: no idea on the guy, and I have seen a lot of mixed reviews on him, I don't like him in the run game and haven't really seen him VS the pass

3) Harold: Yeah ok, value, we may loose 2 of our 3 best OLB next year, OK but don't love it

4) Bell: I like him, nice pick as a No. 2, good enough speed and good at reading zones, why not we may need a TE next year

   Davis: Baalke cannot draft without picking an RB, just a fact. So as we had to draft a back I'm ok with it being a 4th on Davis who is ok but not excellent.

   Smelter: Big, athletic, needs to develop. I don't know about this staff but we have had a lot of issues developing WR before, I hope it changes, but he is definitely worth a 4th complementary pick.

5) Pinion: A punter, we still have one of those, so why invest in a guy

6) Silberman: I suppose we needed a swing tackle, so why not, don't know a lot about the guy, but hell if we aren't going to choose anyone else why not fill a need

7) Brown: Eh, another big guy. Usually we do (did) better at developing the low round lineman than pretty much any other position (except may be corner)

 Anderson: looks like a possible blocking TE, I guess the staff aren't very high on the depth we have at TE"

"2015-05-03 04:04:17","NFL_Draft","Campesinoslive",2,"And crazy how much value each AFC North team got. "
"2015-05-03 04:08:47","NFL_Draft","atheist4thecause",2,"First, with Damarious Randall, he's a decent player, but he's not worth a 1st. We could not have him got him with a 2nd rounder, but I agree with Daniel Jeremiah who said that he's rising late due to the quality of talent over his play rising him up. So that gives a dock. (Btw, it sounds like we are going to play Randall mainly at CB and the fact that he only played 2 years of football plus he's getting converted to CB brings a lot of added risk for a 1st roudner.)

Second, I should say I love Rollins. No complaints there.

Third, Ty Montgomery has talent, but he didn't produce well his final year, IIRC he was coming off of an injury, and again, we took him at the high part of where he could fall. He's another risky guy with talent that will likely have to make his money on ST's to start. I have concerns about his understanding of the game as well, because the Packers will sit players if they don't know their assignments to a T. That's why Bostick couldn't get on the field and I believe that's why Datone Jones doesn't get on the field more. That might even be why we signed Julius Peppers over Nick Perry.

We finally add some competition at OLB, and we do so with Jake Ryan. He's okay, but there's nothing that I'm particularly excited about with him. I think there were other guys to take. I mean, is he really that much better than Mike Hull who didn't even get drafted?

I think we could have done better matching talent to needs without losing value. Then we go with a guy like Hundley and spend 2 picks on him. I like the pick a lot, it's one of my favorites, but it doesn't fill a need. We never really added competition to TE until the 6th round, and we could use 2 guys for competition. We didn't add much at the premium positions such as the DL, OL, pass rushers, etc. Maybe QB counts if you count a backup. We also added a FB, one that I love, but it's more luxury.

Overall, we didn't get good competition for positions where guys could have challenged for starting spots (outside of CB because we did load up there), we didn't match value to need, and we took a lot of guys on the upper end of where they were projected (Randall was a 1st or 2nd and we took him in the 1st, Rollins was a 2nd or 3rd and we took him in the 2nd, Montgomery was a 3rd or 4th and we took him in the 3rd, etc.) In fact, I don't see anybody we really got for good value. So while I like a lot of these guys, there was a lot let to be desired from the team building/draft strategy standpoint."

I disagree, he's worth a 1st round pick this year, in part because of the weak S class, but to a team with a FS need, I still dont understand why you guys selected him, even if as a CB.

As for why we took him, we lost Tramon Williams and Davon House. He's going to come in and fill one of those holes. Then we took Rollins to fill the other hole. I don't think it was completely lost on them that Randall could play S if need be and he can be moved around to disguise a package. The Packers absolutely love versatility, but mainly, I think the hope is for him to be a shutdown corner eventually, and the rest is gravy. I think they know he can play slot, and they are wondering if he can play outside IMO. If he can't, we still have a slot guy, but if he can, that's gravy. So that's the intelligence of the pick, but like I said before, there's a lot of negative. In the end, he's a player, and that's the important thing. Personally, I would have picked Kendricks."

Also, as a Bama fan, I feel bad for this; but I don't see O.J as a first rounder yet. He's all potential and little production so far. He's been incredibly frustrating and inconsistent. Granted, next year's TE class doesn't jump out at me; so he may get overvalued. 

Edit: To at least offer alternative positions, DL could be a big target. I like John Jenkins, but I'm not sold on him as the future NT. 

Akiem Hicks and Cam Jordan are both UFAs after 2015. I wouldn't be surprised if only one is re-signed, so DE could be a need as well. 

ILB could be a need depending on how Ellerbe looks this season.  Hawthorne isn't a long term answer.

He was easily the best QB in the Pac-12 last year not named Marcus Mariota. I think he's leaps and bounds above Hack right now, who is still just a physical specimen. Kessler does everything pretty well, but I'd take him above Hack any day. My biggest question for Kess is: can he produce without NFL talent around him? He had Buck Allen at RB, Agholor and Farmer at WR, and 1 or 2 drafted OL. Luckily, USC killed the recruiting trail this year, so he may have some freshman help. Easily a first rounder IMO. "

Cardale wins the starting job. He is the best QB out of the trio by the coaching staffs' own admission. Last season, he lost the backup job due to character concerns but over the past season he has done everything he can to erase those. His arm is probably unmatched in college football and, despite his 6'5, 250 frame, he is mobile, running 46 times in his three games at starter.

JT is gets screwed. His name is all over OSU's record books, but because Cardale outplayed him and showed everyone who has the better QB tangibles, he'll sit the bench this season and then re-assume the starter's job once Cardale declares. He still has 3 years of eligibility."

- Tyler Boyd (Pittsburgh): You already mentioned him. He produced well (efficiently) despite being over 40% of his team's targets. 

- Rashard Higgins (Colorado State): Biletnikoff Finalist. 1750 yards in 2 fewer games than Cooper. 

- Mike Williams (Clemson): Fantastic hands-catcher and deep threat. In many respects similar to Parker this year. Clemson sure seems to be pumping out great receivers.

I see Cardale Jones as the top pick and while he does offer humongous size and potential, I doubt he'll be as highly touted because of system concerns. We had three quarterbacks come in and succeed for heaven sakes! I like how he makes the team more vertical but don't forget JT Barrett, who just moves the offense with quickness. I think Penn State's QB and style will appease NFL evaluators more. 

What do we think of defensive lineman, Aldolphus Washington ( OSU)? Pretty sure he killed Melvin Gordon having any impact in the B1G championship. 6'4"" at 290lbs, five star recruit and I think he would project best as a five technique in the 3-4 but already plays inside in a 4-3. Handled A LOT of double teams last year and that might be why Michael Bennett was such a good college player.

Two in quick: Joey Bosa (DE) is obviously our pride and joy, sure fire first rounder; didn't know about Taylor Decker (OL) but I'll take the first round grade! Strange considering Decker had little experience until this year.

Vonn Bell (S) is just a junior but I could see him declaring and moving into the first because he's something special. Great kid; likes General Tso from Marketplace a lot.

Like Jones, Ezekiel Elliott (RB) is getting a lot of hype but I don't think he *deserves* it. Our offensive line has played rock solid since the Virginia Tech game, opens huge holes and dominates every play. Sure, Elliott uses his quickness to beat defenders outside (which I don't think will translate to the NFL) but gets a lot of help with misdirection and willing receivers who are regularly blocking down field. Unlike Melvin Gordon, he doesn't have the pressure of stacked boxes either. I always thought Carlos Hyde was the better back, probably the best player on last year's team, and he was drafted in the second."

When you hide a QBs weakness and it's something important, like progressions through defenses in a pro style offense, it doesn't set them up well for success in the future.

Ramsey and White at corner 

Hunter and James at safety

Marshall at star

With Andrews coming in on 6 DB sets as the dime or money corner, the only position he can play at this level. He was exposed as the starting safety. He's not a good enough athlete to play man to man at this level nor can he cover the space needed from a starting S. A lot of FSUs provlems this year were Andrews fault.

Karlos Williams wasn't a great pick, but Bryce Brown is overrated, and Freddie isn't any younger. I don't love Karlos Williams as a player, but there is a reason for him being drafted.

Other than that, I agree with the rest of it, Darby was good value and a fun piece for Rex to groom for next year. Miller is a great run mauler, and Dezmin Lewis was a good value in the 7th.

1 - Arik Armstead -- total project, more of a 2nd round talent, and they admitted they don't expect much this year. I do think with Tomsula they can maximize his talent but not impressed.

2 - Tartt -- safety is not a need and while it could be, and Tartt looks like a real player, I really think they could have waited a round. I heard one guy with an inside source saying Tartt was the guy before Day 2 started ... feels like they just fixed on their guy and didn't try to maximize draft strategy here. 

3 - Eli Harold - GREAT pick, great value. In my head, I switch the order of rounds 2 and 3 and I'm happy.

4 - Blake Bell - great TE prospect, Vernon is on his last legs and Vance McDonald is nothign much (great 2nd round pick of years past, sigh). 

Mike Davis - we always take a RB and he seems like a great complement to our contingent of Hyde, Bush, Hunter and Hayne.

DeAndre Smelter - finally, a WR! Albeit one who probably wont' play in 2015. But we need someone to take Boldin's place after he retires and this is a good plan - but man, we passed on so many WR with more potential and experience.

5 - WE DRAFTED A FUCKING PUNTER. No words justify this abortion of a pick.

6 and 7 - we drafted OL help and yet another TE. 

We also picked up two picks for next year which is great but we are woefully thin on WR and ILB depth and yet we had a PUNTER higher up on our draft board than anyone who matters. Sorry, punters, but even forgetting value we already have Andy Lee, a Pro Bowler punter. This is arrogance, or an admission that the Big Board is useless. We don't need this guy and the 5th round is a place where we got Aaron Lynch last year. Total and complete waste of a pick, even if he's our starter - we can get punters in free agency or the 7th round where I guarantee this guy would have still been sitting around."

_____

**Connor Cook:** Andy Dalton

Solid potential, but nothing special.  Will probably be a starter, but not for any dynasty.  He's a poor man's franchise quarterback.  

Round Projection: 1st Round

**Jared Goff:** Somewhere between Flacco and Foles

Goff tries to force a lot of passes which I don't like.  On the other hand, I feel as though his ceiling is high enough to fix that.  He is almost a lesser version of Jameis Winston in the sense of being a taller pocket who tries to force throws.  Goff's ceiling is nowhere near Winston's, though.

Round Projection: 2nd/3rd Round

**Cardale Jones:** JaMarcus Russell

Product of the Ohio State system.  Urban Meyers is a great coach when it comes to creating systems of success, and systems of ease for his quarterbacks.  I see Cardale being the better version of Bryce Petty.

Round Projection: 3rd/4th Round

**Christian Hackenberg:** Exactly in between what Matt Ryan was supposed to be and Aaron Rodgers

Hackenberg has a great pocket presence, and won't run out unless he has to.  His decision making needs to be a little better, but I think that can be easily coached with Hackenberg.  I see him being the first quarterback to go in the draft.

Round Projection: 1st Round

**Cody Kessler:** Mark Sanchez

To be honest, USC annoys me.  They run a pro-style offense and they have pretty good looking quarterbacks playing there almost every year.  Kessler is also a pretty good quarterback, but then I remember he plays for USC.

By going undrafted, he has entered the league as a free agent. He's considered to be a professional football player (in the league's eyes) whether he signs a deal or not. He really screwed himself by saying he wouldn't sign if he wasn't taken before day three.

If Foster has learned how to tackle without concussing or otherwise injuring himself, he can be a force.  As it stands now, though, he's in line to split snaps with another ILB; so it'll be interesting to see how much playing time he does get."

The issue with Conner is the fact that he's a RB. RB is still a devalued position in my book. Yes Gurley was special and Gordon could be too. Zeke Elliot dominated to earn his spot but could fall down this board if he doesn't show Gurley like qualities/has Gurley like games. Same can be said for Derrick Henry."

I went with 11 on 11 and ignored the bench. I decided to go with a 3-4 defense that uses beef and length as DE's with 2 OLB's that are true pass rushers. I put shorter beef in the middle that can 2-gap and gain leverage. I wanted my outside guys to be taller if I could do it, and I felt Alex Carter and Damion Swann were good enough talents. Doran Grant would be my slot. I tried to avoid character risks, but I felt the character risks were just so much better then the surrounding talent that i had to go with them. I'd look to replace them down the line if they acted up.

On offense, I'm running a ZBS. I think a ZBS is easier to build in the lower rounds. Maybe it's because I'm a Packers fan and I saw what Ted Thompson has been able to build, but I took smaller OT's, and we can let them battle it out in camp to see who goes where. I want them all cross-trained on multiple positions anyways.

"2015-05-05 01:54:37","NFL_Draft","atheist4thecause",2,"There's actually a lot of tape out there on him because he played at Georgia, and he was on the field a lot. He's a ballhawk, and he's tall. He's a on the small side playing around 175-180 (probably closer to 175 to be honest), but he got up to 189 at the Combine. That's a lot like Kevin Johnson, except instead of the 1st Round the Saints got him at the end of the 5th (a big reason I didn't like Kevin Johnson in the 1st was the weight). His times aren't bad either (4.50 40 (1.59 10-split), 33 vert, 9'10"" broad, 4.20 Shuttle, and 6.98 3-cone). He didn't do a bench press, and that is probably because he needs to get stronger. I don't know when he hurt his hamstring, but he didn't do the Shuttle or 3-cone because of it. It makes you wonder if his vert and broad were hurt because of the hammy and he didn't try to redo them at his Pro Day.

Look up his production and it's quite good for where he was drafted. 4 INT's, 1 FR for a TD, 65 tackles (35 solo), 4.5 TFL's, 2 sacks, 8 pass break-ups, 4 QB hurries, and 4 FF's in only 12 games. He's also a 3-year producer. His stats in those main 3 years include 8 INT's, 21 BPU's, 4 sacks, 8.5 TFL's, and 175 tackles.

He is 275 lbs, which is tweener weight. If he can grow, that will help him. I'd like to see him play at 3-4 DE, but if he can't put on weight he's going to have to play at strong side 3-4 OLB most likely. I felt some of his production was due to a very good secondary that was giving him lots of time to get to the QB. He didn't win with his first move very often, but I like how he transitions into other moves to keep fighting. Sometimes I saw him give up on plays against the run, so I see him as a guy who definitely likes to pass rush but maybe doesn't like to play the run as much (and I think playing the run might be what he does in the NFL). He seems like a very high-motor guy, though.

Overall, he seems like a good prospect, but talking about his tape in the league of some of the best ever is just way overstating how good it is IMO. There some serious concerns for me, such as weight, ability to win with the first move, and passion to stop the run. There's a long year ahead so we'll see."

I went with the best player available (by my rankings) who fit Jeff Fisher's system well for each selection. I'll leave a few notes on what exactly Fisher looks for in guys, so you can see how my choices match up.

- QB's with big arms who aren't statues.

- RB's with a bulk and/or burst with all-around skill sets.

- Big WR's on the outside with a quick, shifty guy in the slot.

- Fisher's TE's typically have good size with decent-to-good athleticism and the ability to both catch the ball and block.

- OL who thrive as run blockers with enough athleticism to not be totally anemic in pass protection.

- Fisher likes to mix speed and strength on the defensive line at all times. We'll typically have one twitchy guy and one stronger, run-oriented defender at both end and tackle at any given time.

- In our scheme, our Sam LB mainly has pass rushing and run stopping duties. He's used very fairly in coverage as we'll go Nickel in obvious passing situations. Our Mike LB needs to be solid and instinctual; flash isn't necessary. Fisher typically looks for athletic ability and splash plays from our Will LB.

- We usually have one bigger corner who is a borderline safety with a twitchier guy opposite him. On the inside (in Nickel packages), we typically use a combo CB/S.

- Our FS has to be athletic enough to play centerfield but also solid in run defense. We look for size and aggression in a strong safety. He'll have minimal responsibility in coverage."

Watching him play (I'm a Badgers fan), he always looked really big for a 4-3 DE so that seems about right. Also, I highly doubt that Bosa is going to be a Top Performer in everything but the 40 yard dash 5/6 drills), I'm not sure he'll measure at the 34"" arm length JJ Watt had, and I would be absolutely shocked if Bosa's hands measured at the 11 1/8"" that Watt's measured.

Just watching the two player, Watt had to be double teamed. Watt was disruptive against the pass and the run, and he didn't cheat. He could win often and quickly. He could win after being initially blocked, too. If Maryland tried to block JJ Watt with one blocker all game like they did against Bosa, they wouldn't have had a QB standing when the game was over."

"2015-05-05 04:36:52","NFL_Draft","Barian_Fostate",1,"Not just wasted, but miscast. He doesn't have the anchor to hold up inside imo. He can hold the edge, sure, but taking on multiple blockers ain't his thing."
"2015-05-05 04:37:54","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"He's not going to get taller but he's going to get stronger. He was only a true sophomore and probably played at like 180-185. He actually had his hands on the ball there, so he still got up and made a play on it. Cooper has 20 pounds on him and just outmuscled him. Revis is only 5'11 too."
"2015-05-05 04:38:19","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"He could probably 3 tech, it just wouldn't be optimal."

We drafted a punter ... thud."
"2015-05-05 04:50:25","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"True, but Nkemdiche has a bigger frame so he could add a bit more muscle. However Nkemdiche is clearly not as good of a prospect as Aaron Donald at 3 tech."

That being said, I still want to do more work on Nkemdiche to get a baseline for him before the season. Same for Bosa, Scooby, Calhoun, A'Shawn, and all the safeties"

"2015-05-05 06:36:58","NFL_Draft","A_Smitty56",1,"Three 1st round interior linemen?  A little bit over kill don't you think?  I'd like to see a lineman taken to replace Foster but I wouldn't suggest taking one that early unless it's a LT and they can't pay Beachum.  The Steelers have an excellent pass protection offensive line at the moment, they just need to keep restocking the depth.

That being said, I'm not really sure what the Steelers needs next year will be.  I'd say TE if Jesse James can't be a dominant catcher and blocker, maybe more safeties.  Other than that their pretty solid.

I actually wouldn't be too hurt to see a QB taken early (Oh please, please be Hack!) and sit him for 4-ish years.  Because the Steelersreally don't have many holes on paper other than OG, TE, and FS, unless some players don't work out or unexpectedly leave.  Miles well build towards the future.

I think the main focus would have to be defining the traits and their point total, for example something like size for a EDGE player could be contentious (e.g.  A wants it to be 3 pnts if over 6', 2 more if over 6'2"" where as B wants it to be 5 point if over 6'3"") . There would need to be a lot of discussion on how these fit, if you can get it started count me in.


Personally I think it would be good, and good for the sub to get behind this and may be even use a bit of scouting of the  NFL (something I was going to look into for the niners this year). Scout players, judge their worth based on contracts (i.e. the GMs perceived worth on the guy) and production (not just stats but how they play and fit the scheme) on the NFL level and use it as a basis for the scouting of college players. I keep hearing the NFL scouts are required to go we want to pick this guy as he will replace this guy. i.e. drafting Marcus Martin will replace Dillion Farrel on the roster. I think this will give a bit more of an understanding  as to how the guys yet to be drafted will fit with a team that drafts them"

This isn't directed specifically at you, but people act like Hackenberg had a group of pee wee football players for a line. Donovan Smith was the #1 pick of the 2nd round. Yes there were some inexperienced players on that line, but they gave him good protection for at least 3-4 seconds on most plays. Yes they had a few blown protections, but every line has that problem. Hackenberg's OL was fine and for anyone that doesn't believe me just watch the games against Ohio State and Michigan State.

"2015-05-05 23:37:47","NFL_Draft","Staple_Overlord",1,"You know, I was going to break down each pick the Vikings had, but I think I'll just deviate away from the intention of this thread and post my own blurb on Waynes, who people, including me, tend to doubt. **TL;DR**: I think Waynes went to the best team possible in terms of staff and scheme. He has a ways to go, but he should get there.

If he was expected to be your #1 lockdown corner meant to shut down every team's #1, I'd be worried. But he's not. What Waynes will do is be the teams #2 guy, and he'll give the team flexibility. Last year, Zimmer had to go against his philosophy and put Xavier Rhodes on islands with teams' #1 receivers. Zimmer doesn't like that. Zimmer likes keeping his guys to one side of the field, but Captain and Robinson did not always get the job done. With Waynes, Zimmer won't need to worry about moving Rhodes around. And when you don't need to try and make up for deficiencies in your own defense, that means you can start attacking the offense. So just with Waynes' presence, the defense as a whole should improve.

With that said, I still don't like Waynes' change-of-direction skills. I really thought the Vikings needed a guy like Kevin Johnson—a corner who can handle the Julian Edelman's of the world. But what Waynes does provide, at least, is a guy who can keep up the DeSean Jackson's of the world. The elite deep threats that tend to make the Vikings their bitch. **BUT** if there is one aspect I can find solace in, it's that Xavier Rhodes, who was able to shut down Percy Harvin when the Vikings finally put Rhodes on him during the Jets game, posted an abysmal 4.65 20-yard shuttle at his pro day. Waynes was 4.39 at the combine and 4.09 at his proday. What this tells me is that agility *can* be taught, at least in respect to having more efficient footwork and technique.

And I trust Waynes' ability to learn. He sounds like he's a great kid. Whereas last year's #1 CB, Justin Gilbert, seemed to be a bit of a hothead, Waynes has the same mentality as past Vikings draftees like Anthony Barr. ""Hey, I know I have talent, but I know I'm far from perfect. Let's get down to work so I can be the best me possible."" Zimmer has turned far less talented athletes into good corners. And with Waynes' intelligence and speed, I am at least confident in his ability to grow.

"2015-05-06 00:45:23","NFL_Draft","darkforce547",1,"What's really cool about doing things along the lines of Matt Waldman's RSP checklists is that things like size are irrelevant for the immediate skill set. We'd be focusing on things that are universal. Like, say, with quarterbacks. Arm strength is an important factor, but that's not something we can universally define. Instead, we break it down into things like demonstrating velocity on deep routes or being able to throw a deep ball at all. So, while things like size are important factors, we've seen with players like Russell Wilson that a skilled player can overcome physical deficiencies.

As for scoring, the best thing would be to immediately set ""integral"" skills at 5 points and go from there. If the player can't do that skill, then they won't be able to play the position at the NFL level. From there, it would be scores based upon their importance to the position. So, going with the quarterback example, the intermediate passes are the most important passes that a quarterback throws. As a result, having acceptable accuracy and velocity in the intermediate area should each be worth 5 points. And obviously these points would be all or nothing.

Waldman does something interesting in that he also judges which things a prospect can reasonably be expected to improve on to get to a passable level to create a ""ceiling score"" to project where the player's skill set may end up. On top of that, though, Waldman does include a certain degree of subjectivity. Accompanying the checklist, he ranks each player's overarching skill (Accuracy as a whole, arm strength, etc.). The example that he uses is that Matt Ryan has passable arm strength (committee caliber) to be an NFL quarterback while Michael Vick has exceptional arm strength (star caliber). Waldman's order goes Star, Starter, Committee, Reserve, Free Agent, Deficient.

I think that your idea of looking at guys in the NFL is a great idea. Looking at some of the best talents, we'll be able to get a good idea what it means to do x skill or potentially even come up with skills that we hadn't thought of.

I think that looking at things like scheme fit would definitely help in at least partially predicting where players might be drafted.

I hope to get this started in the next week or two, so look out for it!"

Usually, the best OL on the team will be the LT. Also, typically if you take a true Center, that player will have a tough time playing other positions, especially OT. If you get hit with injuries, it becomes harder to fill that injury. Converting LT's makes it easier to move them around when one guy goes down. That's the thinking there."

"2015-05-06 01:08:28","NFL_Draft","dseals",1,"Watched the entire Indiana game. Counted 6 plays that I considered the line to have given him a bad pocket. Every other play was a good pocket, or Hackenberg threw the ball quickly as he should have. 29 pass attempts, (IIRC) 3 sacks, and 1 scramble. 1 sack was on Hackenberg for simply not throwing the ball away. On the scramble he had at least 4-5 seconds in the pocket before tucking it and running.

So 6 bad pockets on 33 drop backs for a total of 82% success rate on the line. I'd consider that enough protection for a QB to do better than 12 for 29. Most of the time he had 3-4 seconds in the pocket, and I even timed a lot of the snaps to get a good reading on it. If it was the Illinois game, I can't know because that's not on DB."
"2015-05-06 01:15:22","NFL_Draft","Staple_Overlord",14,"I really think matching the combine numbers with tape is important. I think of Kevin White as a prime example—how on earth did he achieve 4.35 speed when people weren't even certain he'd break 4.5? It's hard to find any wrong with a guy running a 4.35 40, but that does raise an eyebrow. What I feel it should do is make you reevaluate the tape and see why he looks slowish on tape. Does he have a poor get-off off the line? Is he just a long strider? Is there a motor issue? Etc, etc.

Basically, the combine is meant to reaffirm what you see on tape. If it doesn't, go back and see if you misunderstood something."
"2015-05-06 01:17:42","NFL_Draft","TheRealNateC",6,"This is great stuff! 

Another thing I would like to add is trust your gut. If you like a player and he's not getting a lot of hype, trust yourself. Of course it wouldn't hurt to go over the film a couple times to check if you're missing anything, but you should trust your gut when you have a really good feeling about a player.

Another even more important one is don't back down. This subreddit has grown so much and when next season rolls around people are gonna disagree on prospects just we all have since the existence of football. If you love a player stand up and be strong in your opinion (ex. /u/Dorago1991 and Jaelen Strong). State what you like about them and why you think they will succeed. Don't rate some guy high on your big board, post it on here, and then have someone tell you he sucks only for you to then push him to the bottom of your board. Also works the other way to. If you don't like a guy that's ok you don't have to like the same people as everybody else. If they point out something to you and you watch more tape and your opinions change that's cool (this happened to me with Kevin White early on in the process). Just don't let other opinions be yours. That's probably the biggest mistake I see people make in our armchair scouting community. "

"2015-05-06 01:44:16","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",3,"Very good points here. The only think I would add is that for quarterbacks throwing on crossing routes, throwing behind them isn't always a bad throw. If a defender is coming across the middle to meet your receiver then leading him is a good way to get him lit up. In that situation throwing behind him is a smarter move because it turns him around and protects him from the hit.  It's really about the situation."
"2015-05-06 01:54:31","NFL_Draft","sio-kedelic",6,"Nice! I'll add in the things I learned. This year was the first year I REALLY got into the draft and tried scouting multiple positions.

- it seems silly, but hand size and arm length really are important. For skill position players, it helps with ball security, catching and throwing the ball, and using length and height to highpoint the ball. For linemen/LBs, an extra half inch could be a big difference in how effective they are blocking or rushing the passer. OL need to explode into the rushers' chest and DL need to keep their length from the OL, bend around them, and have big/strong hands to disengage and attack. DBs need big hands and long arms to attack skill position players.

- A receiver can have a varying amount of targets over a season if you look up the information. This is because catchable balls aren't totally objective and can vary from source to source. The easiest way to obtain this reliable info? Chart it yourself!

- Similarly, watch how a receiver or RB catches the ball. Just because a receiver is getting the ball a bunch doesn't necessarily mean that his game is flawless, and those flaws are gonna be what is exploited at the next level. Are they using their hands entirely to catch the ball, or do they need to use their body? Are they catching the ball away from their body, and in what positions can they catch the ball? How late can they get their hands up and still attack the ball at its highest point? Are they coming back to their QB and using their body to box out DBs? Can they improvise when their QB is in trouble? Are they showing that they can run a full route tree comfortably, or do they consistently drop the ball? These questions are all much more important than ""did he catch that, and how many yards did it get him?""

- LBs are hard to scout, especially ILBs/MLBs. A linebacker is asked to fill gaps, sit in zones, attack running lanes, line up his team, and trail tight ends in coverage. A game may appear like they aren't doing anything, but they're actually covering well in zone and forcing plays to their teammates; conversely, a high-tackle game could just be a blowout that has the defense reacting too late and recovering after a bunch of big gains. Their responsibilities can vary wildly from game to game, and with stats often being so misleading for the position, I like to watch more games of them than I would other positions. This'll help you understand the team's defensive scheme, how they use him, and what (if any) holes in his game the scheme may be hiding.

- I want to reiterate the ""listening to other peoples' opinions"" point. Quite frankly, unless this is your full-time job, you don't have time to watch every game for every prospect. Discussing a prospect you like with someone who isn't high on them can help point out flaws you may not have seen and helps eliminate any bias you might have for a prospect. There are many different ways to view the same tape, and integrating those alternative views into your own beliefs can give a surprisingly accurate representation of a player."
"2015-05-06 01:58:34","NFL_Draft","2PacTookMyLunchMoney",3,"I agree that ideal ball placement can be very situational, but I'm trying to be a general as possible with these points. Generally speaking, throwing behind a receiver is very bad."

"2015-05-06 02:16:05","NFL_Draft","atheist4thecause",1,"I have to go with Minnesota. Trae Waynes is pretty athletic, Eric Kendricks was a potential 1st Round choice and MIN got him at #45, Danielle Hunter has some upside in the 3rd, TJ Clemmings obviously has tons of potential and if his injury shortens his career it'll still be worth the pick in the 4th if he lives up to his potential (and whether he develops or not is on the coaches, not the GM). I get a little colder on some of these other guys, especially MyCole Pruitt, but I think Tyrus Thompson has the potential to be a future starter. He was my #9 OT and that's counting Collins as an OT, so really like my #8 OT. I also like Diggs a lot, not only because of his 4.46 40 speed, but also because of his 10"" hands and all-around decent athleticism. Nothing really jumps out at you as bad. Maybe the Broad? Overall, MIN catches up yet again. They've had excellent drafts the last 3 years."
"2015-05-06 02:19:46","NFL_Draft","backgrinder",0,"One of the biggest indicators of good arm strength is a really tight spiral on the ball.

Not really. There is no relationship between strength and a tight spiral at all. A spiral may indicate good technique and a loose, limber arm. If you see a ball traveling without the spiral and/or the nose wobbling the QB is pushing the ball instead of spinning it. That doesn't mean they have a weaker arm, but usually it means they will be a little less accurate in ball placement. 

 For a good example Tim Tebow is stronger physically than Aaron Rogers, and probably has a bit stronger arm for purposes of throwing. He was ruined by the coaching staff at Florida though. They let him work out with the offensive linemen and he developed a thick tight band of muscle over the front of his shoulder. It affected his follow through and he pushes the ball when he throws. Rogers, with less physical strength has a loose arm, he can whip through the follow through and put the ball right where he wants it. He also gets a pretty tight spiral with his motion."

"2015-05-06 02:32:42","NFL_Draft","saint52",8,"One thing I have noticed is everyone has a different grading scale. We all value different things. Things like size factor heavily for some, and for others it isn't as big of an issue. Other people grade on a potential, rather than a floor. And some again grade for risk reward. Just because the ranking is different doesn't mean you have different opinions on the player. You should find out what they are grading for and see if it makes sense before commenting, may be their style is the antithesis of your own, but you may be able to take some pointers from it.
For example everyone really liked Amari Cooper because he was a crisp route runner and was usually getting force fed the ball, but one analyst I listened too had him as their 4th receiver. (Parker, white, Perryman then Cooper). This was not because he didnt like cooper (still had his as a top 15 prospect) but because he perceived coopers ceiling as being Michael Crabtree, which to him is not worth a high pick. 


Another example is /u/EonKayoh and /u/4arc both grade using potential as the key factor (correct me if I am wrong) and as such to some of us their ranks may seem off or wrong. But they usually feel similar about prospects as we do, they just have ranked their prospects based on what they could be not what they are now. Example Hundley being EonKayoh 2nd QB, I understand why he was put there, but I don't necessarily  agree, but I can see  the points raised and agree that if that is the view taken Hundley should be the no. 2 QB on the board.

"2015-05-06 02:34:57","NFL_Draft","2PacTookMyLunchMoney",4,"""Arm strength"" is more than just having strong arms. In fact, the actual strength a guy has in his arms is pretty irrelevant. Technique is the driving force behind arm strength. Putting tighter spin on the ball and adding ""oomph"" on a throw are directly correlated. The quicker and smoother a ball spins the faster it's going to move. It's a simple matter of science. Less resistance equals more speed.

&amp;nbsp;

Watch some throws in slow motion. Guys who are generally considered to have strong arms spin the ball at an elite level. Guys with weaker arms, like Peyton Manning (currently), will throw a wobbly ball."

I would like to see some progression next year, even minor. Just so I know he has the room to grow there. But right now I'd say he's going to be the favorite to go number one overall if a team that needs a quarterback is picking. Which they usually are, or someone that does will move up for their guy."
"2015-05-06 03:07:02","NFL_Draft","backgrinder",0,"Strength for throwing comes from the legs, the spin is generated by the wrist and hand. Older QB's will struggle more to put a clean spin on the ball not because they are physically weaker but because their arm is less limber. This also makes them less accurate, because they start to push the ball to compensate. The two concepts are related, but they are not the same thing. And look at your stats the other way---has every QB you've seen with a cannon of an arm put a perfect spin on the ball? The answer to that is a definite no. The spin comes from having a limber arm and a great release. 

 Have you ever thrown a football? I mean worked at it, practiced, spent real time on it? This is something you'd grasp instinctively if you had worked on this particular skill. You can put a perfect rotation on a softly thrown ball thrown under 20 yards. You can throw a ball 70 yards in the air with no spin at all just by muscling up on it and using raw strength. There just isn't any connection between strength and rotation.

Something I would add is that what a player did in college, is not always indicative of what he is capable of in the NFL. For example, one big knock on Mariota this year was his offensive system setting up easy reads, and wide open throws. While that is certainly true, that does not mean that he is incapable of making throws into tighter windows or read defenses (side note, Mariota read defenses more often than most analysts would have you think).

"2015-05-06 03:41:27","NFL_Draft","EonKayoh",3,"As far as QBs go, I've got 3 filters.

1. Ability to translate directly to the NFL quickly.  This is basically the scheme check - guys like Mariota, Petty and Hundley all fail this check while guys like Winston, Grayson and from the previous year, Bridgewater, all pass.  The reason this is so important to me is because if you can't become a contributing starter, you're going to be asked to start as a rookie anyway, and highly drafted QBs who fail as rookies very rarely recover from a psychological/confidence standpoint.  For every Peyton Manning there are dozens of examples where guys like Joey Harrington, Blaine Gabbert, etc, get thrust into starting jobs before they're ready, fail early, and never fully develop into starting caliber QBs.
2. Pocket ability.  Not necessarily just pocket presence, but also just natural ability in the pocket.  To me, pocket presence is more about awareness - knowing what's going on around you, and that's a *part* of pocket ability, but only a part, not the whole picture.  Pocket ability is a combination of pocket presence - knowing what's going on around you - and the ability to use that knowledge to make plays happen.  This is the Russell Wilson factor, but it can also be the Ben Roethlisberger factor.  You don't have to be overly elusive, although that's one way of dealing with pressure.  As long as the guy can sense pressure, and knows how to either get rid of the ball before the pressure gets to him, or has the elusiveness to avoid the pressure without panicking and going from passer to runner, OR have the power to shrug off &amp; break would-be sacks - those are the three options, and as long as you possess one of them, you pass this filter.
3. Arm talent.  Three extremely important factors: accuracy, velocity, and awareness.  Awareness is knowing whether to throw a bullet or a touch pass consistently.  Velocity is being able to throw the ball on a rope - the deeper the QB is able to throw the ball ""bullet style"", the better.  And accuracy is the most important of the three, because there's never been an inaccurate QB in college that went on to become an accurate QB in the NFL.  In the modern NFL, if you aren't completing 2/3rds of your passes, you ain't cutting it.

The reason I put Hundley above Mariota was because neither one of them passed the first two filters, and Hundley has more arm talent than Mariota.  That's all it is, really.

Any other position, though?  I've got a very different scouting process.

The #1 thing I look at is film.  I make a judgement based on that and there's nothing scientific about it, literally just how good does the guy look with pads on, how good is he against college competition.

The next thing I look at is combine numbers.  People act like they don't matter, but at the end of the day there are reasons why certain guys like Aarom Maybin and Jarvis Jones fail in the NFL.  It's incredibly possible for a college player to dominate college competition but not be athletic enough to do the same in the NFL.  Maybin, Jones, even Andre Branch, all guys that fit into this category.  There are some positions that combine numbers matter more for.  The #1 position that combine numbers mean the most for is EDGE, which is why I'm using EDGE players as examples of why bad combine numbers can directly translate to NFL failure.  I'd say the position that the combine means the least for is WR.  Most positions is just kind of an ""as long as your x drill wasn't worse than y"" filter rather than a ""the better you did at drill x, the better you are"" kind of thing.  Perfect example, if a RB runs anything over a 4.7 40, I immediately take them off my big board.  Little stuff like that.  This goes the same for pro days.

The final thing I do is go back and try to find any prospects with exceptional combine/pro day numbers, and re-watch their film to check and see if those skills translate on the field.  This is why I was so high on Randy Gregory going into the draft - his pro day 3 cone drill was ridonkulous, and that's what sent me back to the tape in the first place.  That combined with the video analysis /u/barian_fostate put out on Gregory had me sold on him."

"2015-05-06 04:29:46","NFL_Draft","atheist4thecause",1,"I had positional rankings, but I didn't put them into a Big Board this year. Due to all of those user mocks, I have a pretty good idea of where I had guys, though. My rankings obviously weren't meant to be a mock, but I had Tyrus Thompson as my #8 OT (not including Collins who I ranked as an OT but thought was an OG) and he went in the 6th. That puts him in the 2-3 Round range, more likely the bottom end of the 2nd. Arie Kouandjio was my #2 interior OL putting him in the 2nd Round in my rankings, and he went in the 4th. There were a couple of guys I didn't have enough tape to qualify for a ranking, Ali Marpet was one, but I did see some stuff on him and I thought he would go in the 4th and went in the high 2nd. I had Marcus Hardison as my #4 big DL (although I didn't have enough tape on him) and he went in the 4th. Trey DePriest was about a 4th-5th rounder for me and he went undrafted.

I didn't have too many shockers. If you're talking in the 1st Round, I guess Damarious Randall was my biggest shocker. He went in the 1st and I expected him to go more in the 3rd. Cody Prewitt wasn't a 1st Rounder but I thought he'd go in the 2nd-3rd and he went undrafted. Although I didn't have many shockers, I really didn't put myself out there too much, either in the early rounds. I thought the media had it pretty much pegged. The 2nd Round got me the most probably."

I also like some of the late round talent they got in Rory ""Busta"" Anderson, Trenton Brown and DeAndre Smelter. Overall a very solid draft top to bottom, but a weird 5th round punter selection.

"2015-05-06 09:17:59","NFL_Draft","lurkedlongtime",1,"On the Pittsburgh development department, yes we have fallen off a bit. Shamarko is about to be a starter, and was a 4th rounder, he didnt get development time because he was doomed to be Troys groomed heir. Though i do think its odd that we maybe kept him... so concealed. There was playtime when Troy went down. Pitt didnt go to Shamarko they went to Will Allen a 12th year safety. At the same time, its a huge boon that Pitt hasnt signed a new SS, hasnt drafted one either. The plan is clear for shamarko to start.


Jarvis is a good point, honestly however... after his lackluster rookie year he showed promise with 2 sacks in 2.5 games (breaking his wrist on his 2nd sack) he wasnt gamebreaking, but he showed improvement.


But Its still the same coach (Keith Butler) that created James Harrison, LaMarr Woodley, and etc. 


I agree though... Bud Dupree is the point where our LB coaching staff cant have many excuses, we hit a bad point with Shazier and Jarvis missing most of the season with injuries. So we have no clue if they can get Shazier going. Jones looked like the light may have clicked on a bit more than a season ago. But Bud... if our Coaching staff (who the same LB coach is on Staff, Kieth Butler) that made Monsters in James Harrison (UDFA) and LaMarr Woodley to pro bowlers and all pro type guys... the things he should be able to do with Bud Dupree are nasty.... but hes gotta prove hes still the same coach that can do that. and hes moved on to DC. Joey Porter was added to teach the players how he played. Time to see if hes worth the money. Bud Dupree is basically how we are going to find out.


As for Coates, I find your point a little odd on saying we need to spend our money on Brown, I dont think it was our best pick Im not sure what your point is about Money.


AB is locked down for years to come, He doesnt become a UFA until 2018, its not like Coates is going to interfere with that at all.



Coates i understand the Idea, we did it with Martavis Bryant and succeeded massively Raw, physically gifted WR that quite frankly ran no routes, and dropped balls a lot in college. and we molded him into quite possibly a starter in 1 season and he looks pretty good.


WR we have a potentially strong top 3 Martavis and AB, along with Wheaton. Coates will probably be expected to, in time challenge Wheaton or Bryant if he slacks off. But beyond our top 3 we have... DHB and we dont want him on the field a ton if god forbid something happens.


They say it was BPA for them, I might honestly believe it. He sounds like a higher character Martavis, and we had him iirc as a second rounder or so when we drafted him. Im not sure I agree, but I also trust our recent WR history.


The idea is depth, potential cracking top 3 and the real reason... is if Coates develops like we got Bryant started so far, we could have the following offensive formation.


Bryant and Coates 2 huge speed, freak deep ball kinda of guys on the outside. AB in the slot.


Heath at TE, LeVeon at HB. Hell, you could take Heath out and still have Wheaton in 4 WR sets.


Thats gotta be a disgusting formation. Coates and Bryant are big and fast enough, that in theory that has to draw pressure away from AB. Then you have one of the best RBs in the NFL behind the QB, and a TE like miller to work the middle. Thats all with a QB that can create time for guys to get open.



I should also note I'm not trying to argue with ya as a homer or anything, I'm basically just here bored and figured I would give some context behind the ideas here. "
"2015-05-06 10:24:07","NFL_Draft","backgrinder",0,"Not every NFL QB can throw the ball 70 yards. A surprising number of them can't, actually. That's fine though, most never need to throw the ball more than 30-40 yards in a straight line anyways. Anyways, whether you are talking ball speed or distance thrown rotation just doesn't have that much effect. Again, mechanically strength is generated by the legs, the rotation is established by the throwing motion in the arm. A QB is just like a baseball pitcher, proper technique is to drive the ball with the legs and steer it with the arm. "

His footwork is a definite concern but if he improved on that and was a starter for Ohio State next season then he's a definite first round talent in my eyes, especially with his arm and prototypical build.

Question: For your GM rankings, what happens if your GM was never really the player personnel guy, but was a part of a group decision.

Good speed but not a true burner, no effort on blocks and even some of his routes looked lazy, not to mention very sloppy. Even with improved route running I don't know if I would use a first on him. You could make the case, I just can't stand half assing it."
"2015-05-06 23:33:26","NFL_Draft","_b_e_n_",1,"What's intersting about that? I didn't love the Mariota pick, but it was a value pick for a potential franchise changer. If the people that did the background checks on DGB decided he was clear to be drafted, then he was a steal at 40.

I'm not just saying this cause its the Jags haha. You can check my rankings from months ago, I've had Fowler low all year and I think we can all agree that Yeldon was a a reach at the front of the second.

Just my opinion."

"2015-05-07 01:01:01","NFL_Draft","CBusin",3,"The spring game was disappointing. But JT Barret and Cardale looked like trash in the 2014 spring game. I'm not placing any weight on his performance three weeks ago.

A few of my concerns with him based off of last season, first is obviously, his footwork. Another is his pocket presence, if he was an average sized QB, Alabama was very close to two safeties coming from his back side. 

As stated previously, his timing and intermediate routes needs more touch and accuracy. 

Another is his deep ball. Clearly he has amazing arm strength and touch. But many of those deep passes were to Devin Smith who was probably the best receiver we've had at OSU in 15 years in terms of getting position on those routes. I'd like to see how well his deep passes are without a safety net like him.

He does have a great attitude and collectiveness you want to see at the QB position. Also, his decision making did not suffer when down 21-6 to Alabama. OSU didn't start coming back until he understood that Bama was coming with pressure and he was going to have to get hit a few times. He stood right in there and delivered very accurate throws at the last possible moment."
"2015-05-07 01:03:54","NFL_Draft","sRW44",2,"Cook's biggest problem at the moment is that he doesn't set his feet or step into his throws. I'm sure that it's the main thing the staff is working on with him this offseason, as multiple coaches have mentioned it multiple times. He does, get jittery as the pocket collapses, but he's becoming more and more comfortable with it.

His biggest strength, IMO, is that absolutely nothing rattles this kid. Every time he makes a mistake he comes back on the next drive and lights it up. Also, the bigger the game the better he plays (he has B1G championship game, Rose Bowl and Cotton Bowl MVPs on his resume)."
"2015-05-07 01:05:42","NFL_Draft","LeM1stre",2,"Are we gonna get a Jared Goff scouting report?"
"2015-05-07 01:14:52","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",3,"The stepping into his throws is my biggest worry with him. I like Hackenberg's potential more, but right now Cook is my number one."
"2015-05-07 01:15:44","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",2,"Him and Kessler are next. They don't have anything in draft breakdown so it may take a little longer but they are next in line."
"2015-05-07 01:17:12","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",3,"I'm not holding the spring game against him, just tempered my expectations. He certainly has the poise and natural ability to be a star, he just needs major mechanics work."

"2015-05-07 01:41:01","NFL_Draft","LeM1stre",1,"I think the Eagles had a solid draft, but I'd also give a nod to the Giants. Their first 3 picks are all good prospects, especially the value of Odighizuwa in the 3rd"
"2015-05-07 02:10:12","NFL_Draft","thehbrwhammer",2,"Yeah it's understandable. I mean some people are drafted to be special teamers though. For example we drafted Evan Spencer (OSU WR) with his 12 catches last year because he's a special teams monster. Had do you define success or failure on those 7th rounders? Or is this supposed to make them seem less successful because they usually are less successful?

 [**Washington Redskins draft history**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington%20Redskins%20draft%20history): [](#sfw)

&gt;

&gt;This is a list of the __Washington Redskins NFL Draft selections__. The [Washington Redskins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Redskins) franchise was founded as the [Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston,_Massachusetts) Braves, named after the local baseball franchise.  The team changed their name to the Redskins in [1933](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1933_NFL_season) and moved to [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.) in [1937](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1937_NFL_season). 

&gt;Every year during April, each NFL franchise seeks to add new players to its roster through a collegiate [draft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports\)) known as the ""[NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Draft),"" which is more commonly known as the NFL Draft. Teams are ranked in inverse order based on the previous season's record, with the worst record picking first, and the second worst picking second and so on. The two exceptions to this order are made for teams that appeared in the previous [Super Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl); the Super Bowl champion *always* picks 32nd, and the Super Bowl loser *always* picks 31st. Teams have the option of trading away their picks to other teams for different picks, players, cash, or a combination thereof. Thus, it is not uncommon for a team's actual draft pick to differ from their assigned draft pick, or for a team to have extra or no draft picks in any round due to these trades. 

&gt;The [Boston Redskins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Redskins) were one of the nine original franchises that participated in the [1936 NFL Draft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936_NFL_Draft), which was the first official [draft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Draft) of the [National Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League). The first player ever selected in the draft, [Heisman Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy) winner [Jay Berwanger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Berwanger), chose not to play professional football. [Riley Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riley_Smith_(American_football\)), taken second overall by the Redskins, holds the distinction of being the first drafted player to play in the NFL.  The Redskins also hold the distinction of being the only team to draft the same player in two different drafts, [Cal Rossi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Rossi). [a]

"2015-05-07 02:19:03","NFL_Draft","backgrinder",1,"You are grossly overestimating the amount of change in wind resistance a slight wobble puts on the ball, dude. You also seem to be misunderstanding one of the basic facts here. We aren't comparing a ball with no spin vs. a ball with spin, we are comparing two balls with varying degrees of rotation. A ball with no spin at all will not travel as far as one with rotation, but changing the speed of rotation of two spinning balls doesn't make the big difference you seem to think it makes over the relatively short distances and slow speeds footballs travel during a passing play.

 The nose wobble does make one big difference. Not in speed or distance, that's pretty negligible. Wobble creates turbulence that affects the balls wake in the air enough to make it....wait for it......wait for it......veer slightly off course. Or make it slightly less accurate, which is why scouts take note of tight spirals. They don't fly farther, at least not enough to shift margin of error beyond that which a QB can account for by adjusting his own throwing strength and ball arc. They do affect accuracy, by a small margin, but in the NFL small margins in accuracy (or precision, if you prefer this weeks buzzword) do make a difference. 

 You clearly don't trust anything I say, and you clearly refuse to even consider you might need to adjust your position in any way. Research this a bit though, there have been a few articles and scientific papers published on football aerodynamics. Maybe you can do a little better next time you decide to come down from your mountain and present the internet with your stone tablet store of knowledge. "

"2015-05-07 02:29:17","NFL_Draft","dseals",1,"Thanks! Exactly what I could use!

And I mean it's not like I'm trying to make them seem less successful, but the fact is most guys drafted in the 7th are pretty much long shots to make the team anyway. I can't even count how many 7th round guys I looked at that were out of the league in less than 3 years. It really makes hitting on those late round guys look that much better."
"2015-05-07 02:37:21","NFL_Draft","dseals",2,"Also, from the 2009 class would you really consider Buehler and McGee successes? I mean yeah, I called Phillips a success, but McGee was pretty bad AFAIK and Buehler wasn't all that great for a kicker wasn't he?"

"2015-05-07 02:59:12","NFL_Draft","_b_e_n_",1,"Depends what position you wanted. I had a guy at every position rated higher than Yeldon at that point other than quarterback."
"2015-05-07 03:03:41","NFL_Draft","down42roads",1,"The 2009 draft was a terrible dumpster fire, and Dallas was the warm molten center.

I guess I just wanted to remember things better, but looking back, yeah, you're right."
"2015-05-07 03:07:26","NFL_Draft","2PacTookMyLunchMoney",1,"I'm not refusing to adjust my position. You are simply providing half of the argument. Throwing a football is a full body activity. You were right when you said the legs play a major factor in arm strength, but a clean release, usually represented by a tight spiral, is key as well. You can build up all the momentum you want with your legs, but if the ball isn't leaving your hand smoothly, your velocity will decrease. Combine a shaky with release with a less aerodynamic ball, and you'll have a problem with velocity. Like I said earlier, it's a matter of science. Football is a game of inches and seconds, so even the slightest variation in speed can play a factor on timing.

&amp;nbsp;

But hey, you are clearly butthurt (for some reason) despite me not typing anything condescending or rude, so I'm done. There's no reason to get upset. My intention here was not to act like I'm on top of a mountain. It was to help people who enjoy the draft as much as me avoid simple mistakes. Everyone else who replied to this thread seems to understand that. I'm not sure why you don't."
"2015-05-07 03:09:21","NFL_Draft","dseals",2,"Hey now that's the draft where we picked Cushing, Barwin, Quinn, Casey, and signed Foster afterwards. I loved 2009."
"2015-05-07 03:15:31","NFL_Draft","backgrinder",1,"There are some weaknesses in your methodology. For one you are only accounting for player, not their situation. Winning a starting job in Tampa Bay is a very different thing than winning a starting job in New England or Seattle right now. 

 You are judging all players on a single criteria without accounting for draft position. I would suggest that getting a starter out of a late round pick is a better job by the GM than getting one from a high pick. A 6th or 7th rounder who never starts but sticks around for a while is a great pickup for that draft slot. JT O'Sullivan from this list is a good example, never started but getting a backup QB who plays for 9 seasons in the 6th round is a great use of a pick.

As far as draft classes in NOLA from 2002-2005 goes here's my 2 cents:

2002

1 	13 	Donte' Stallworth 	Starter, very productive	

1 	25 	Charles Grant 	   Starter, solid player

2 	44 	LeCharles Bentley 	 Pro Bowl Starter

3 	82 	James Allen 	bust

4 	125 	Keyuo Craver 	backup

5 	150 	Mel Mitchell 	backup

6 	186 	J.T. O'Sullivan 	long time backup QB

6 	196 	John Gilmore 	bust

7 	224 	Derrius Monroe     bust


2003

1 	6 	Johnathan Sullivan 	all time bad bust

2 	37 	Jonathan Stinchcomb 	initially a bust, turned into solid starter

3 	86 	Cie Grant 	bust

4 	102 	Montrae Holland 	sometime backup, sometime starter

5 	155 	Melvin Williams 	backup

"2015-05-07 03:24:38","NFL_Draft","dseals",1,"Again this is something I couldn't account for because I can't know this stuff which is why I'm asking for help. I don't know every team's situation as to why they drafted a player or whether that player was even the backup or 3rd string or a special teams pickup or what. I can't know this stuff, but I am factoring in draft position into whether a player was a success or not.

I'm also factoring in the fact that they played well when I looked at these players. I didn't just say ""well he started so he must have been good,"" but at the same time that is a huge factor. I tried to not just base a pick solely off production because you can have fluke seasons and players that step up when a starter gets injured and then fall back into mediocrity.

And as I said elsewhere, it's simply not possible for me to be able to individually rank all of these players as good picks, bad picks, ok picks, etc. because again, I haven't watched all of these guys play. I don't know what they were drafted for, and trying to say x pick was a better pick than y gets too opinion based.

But thank you for the draft information!"

Once you have better info on each team you will start to see some teams getting production in different ways, by building depth, by keeping players longer term, that sort of thing. Just something to watch out for."
"2015-05-07 04:26:09","NFL_Draft","dseals",1,"Yeah that's something I can get into at a later date. Right now I'm focused more on just compiling the information into a nice even success to failure ratio to really show off the difficulties of drafting.

When I go to create the GM power rankings (much farther down the road) then I'll be looking for the late round steals and the early round busts etc."

One thing I've been wanting to compile is a list of 5-6 starter drafts, which are less common than most think, and compare it to a list of playoff/superbowl teams.

And then the late round picks really are just a shot in the dark. I mean if you're just unlucky then might miss on every single day 3 pick multiple times.

I just found it amazing how much Texans fans criticize Rick Smith's drafting when according to my data (which isn't the greatest measurement) he's actually a pretty damn good drafter. Although once I factor in bust to steal ratings that could drastically change.

But I think there is a huge correlation. Seahawks had an amazing track record in their drafts leading up to the Super Bowl. There is definitely a strong link there, but finding it would be the hard part."

Any of them could be the starter week 1, but I think Miller will be since this is it for him while both Jones and Barrett have more years of eligibility. With Jones being a RS Sophomore and Barrett being a RS Freshman. Let Miller start if he slips up in goes Jones and if Jones messes up Barrett is in."
"2015-05-07 07:04:10","NFL_Draft","atheist4thecause",3,"Great post! I personally love to see division rivals Detroit and Minnesota sitting out, and I like to see New England sitting out. That's a mistake on their part IMO. (Yeah, yeah, the Patriots won a Super Bowl without taking one of these WR's, but they were far from a dominant team, and their issues were largely due to their WR corps. The chips just fell right for them.)

The Eagles grabbed Jordan Matthews and Nelson Agholor. Man, that is going to be a good comb if Agholor pans out (I think he'll be decent but I have some doubts), and if their QB can get them the ball. Matthews is really good already.

I really like what the Dolphins got the most. Landry seems solid and Parker provides some serious talent. Joe Philbin knows how to do a lot with average talent, but now he will have his shot to do a lot with a lot. Move over New England, there's a new big boy in town."
"2015-05-07 07:09:41","NFL_Draft","A_Livins",6,"I agree that Rivers needs a guy to stretch the field, but we've had much bigger needs the last 2 drafts. 2014 draft we needed a starting corner, pass rusher, nose tackle, etc. And 2015 draft, we needed a pure RB1, a pass rusher (still), d-line help, a guard, etc.

A WR would be nice, but we've had other spots to fill, and I'm fine with the core of Allen, Floyd, Johnson, Inman, and Jones with Gates and Green at TE."
"2015-05-07 07:11:34","NFL_Draft","atheist4thecause",6,"It's not really about needs. It's more about taking the talent where it exists."
"2015-05-07 07:21:39","NFL_Draft","A_Livins",4,"Very true, but some of those needs were ""fix immediately"" time things. Like 2014 we went in to the draft preparing to start Shareece Wright and Richard Marshall at CB (hadn't picked up Flowers yet). And this year we desperately needed a RB to take the pressure off of Rivers.

Rivers have proven before than he can work magic with not very good WRs. We won games in the past with Legedu Naanee and Seyi Ajirotutu playing significant time at WR.

But again, I still agree that the Chargers could have picked up a WR in the last 2 years in the 1st 3 round, and I would have been fine with it."
"2015-05-07 09:23:33","NFL_Draft","saint52",1,"The issue is with the niners is we have players just not a great one and are investing in where we put value and not just shotgunning value over the depth chart. I don't think it really is a ""Who has egg on their face"" incident. We have yet to see if any of these WR have any kind of sustained success. For example Sammy Watkins has had ongoing issues with his ribs, and may always be in and out of the line up, and if he is the value given up for him would be ridiculous. Paul Richardson hasn't gone much further than any of the other seattle WR. For this year some players have major questions about thier ability, i.e. Funchess, Coates and Perriman, what happens if they don't pan out? WR is a highly volatile position, usually only 2 or 3 make lasting careers out of it in each draft, so just because there are a lot of high quality investments doesn't mean all of them will pan out like last year. So it isn't really that big of a deal if some teams missed out on people high in the draft, so long as we get starters elsewhere, we should be fine."
"2015-05-07 09:39:09","NFL_Draft","saint52",1,"I would argue Kilgore was a hit, in the 5th round a guy who can start at C and is a swing interior lineman for 4 years is very good value in the 5th, especially for the cap hit he causes.

Looney in the 4th is another swing interior lineman, not great value but not a miss

Carradine it is too early to tell,same with Lemonier, Patton, Dial and both Moody and Daniels have been backups in the league since they were drafted, never spending too long in Free agency, so realistically they didnt do too bad for where they were drafted.

Another one I would argue is the Lattimore, he was injured, that isn't really an issue with drafting, so much as an issue medically, like dinging Peyton for the neck issue."
"2015-05-07 09:44:57","NFL_Draft","saint52",2,"Just a thought but could it be a bit more refined. Like career added value, seasonal added value or spectrum instead of hit and miss. You could even average it by rounds, for example an expected Added value of 0, more points equals a better pick, less points equals a worse pick, so its just the deviation by pick rather than comparing a 1st round hit to a 7th round backup
For example a 7th rounder who is now a swing tackle is a better pick than a 2nd rounder who is a swing tackle. Also I think this also has to take into account the quality of coaches, i.e. Blount's best season occurred under Steve logan as his position coach, as such some of that success could be attributable to him. Also the 49ers have been atrocious at developing WR, and as such haven't given back to the GM for providing a person to teach"

"2015-05-07 11:36:41","NFL_Draft","duebex",6,"I feel like Shaq Thompson is another Tweener player - too small to play linebacker and seems too slow to be a safety. Curious as to what Carolina do with him. "
"2015-05-07 12:08:20","NFL_Draft","Jed08",1,"&gt; 1 - Arik Armstead -- total project, more of a 2nd round talent, and they admitted they don't expect much this year. I do think with Tomsula they can maximize his talent but not impressed.

Well if there is someone who can transform his potential in talent, it's Tomsula, even though he is not DL coach anymore. He may prepare a special training plan for him (same as Okoye ?)...

So I am not shocked by the pick, just disapointed, I would have wished we trade down deeper (around 22-25) before picking him...

&gt; 2 - Tartt -- safety is not a need and while it could be, and Tartt looks like a real player, I really think they could have waited a round. I heard one guy with an inside source saying Tartt was the guy before Day 2 started ... feels like they just fixed on their guy and didn't try to maximize draft strategy here. 

Not a need ? Only 3 S with one who already had 3 concussions, and one who can retire next year ? I think it is a need. And the buy is beast. So I understand the pick despite I wasn't very fond of it at the time.

&gt; DeAndre Smelter - finally, a WR! Albeit one who probably wont' play in 2015. But we need someone to take Boldin's place after he retires and this is a good plan - but man, we passed on so many WR with more potential and experience.

The same type of player as Boldin. And since he tored his ACL in November, he could be healthy enough to train and play a few matches during the second hal of the season.

&gt; 5 - WE DRAFTED A FUCKING PUNTER. No words justify this abortion of a pick.

A punter who can kick a 65-yards field goal... And the Patriots took a long snaper the pick just after. So I don't really think we could have had a better pick.

&gt; Sorry, punters, but even forgetting value we already have Andy Lee, a Pro Bowler punter

And old and how expensive is Andy Lee ?

&gt; This is arrogance, or an admission that the Big Board is useless

The big board means nothing to teams. They are capable of evaluating players themselves."

"2015-05-07 13:41:50","NFL_Draft","pfftYeahRight",3,"You won't see any Bengals fans disagreeing that we should've taken someone. All 3 (Green, Jones, Sanu) are in the last year of their contracts. I guess by getting both of our future OTs this year the money saved will definitely make us able to keep 2 of them, but WR depth is definitely still a concern for us.

Edit: The team does feel highly on 7th rounder James Wright from last year, hopefully he continues to develop. He's got great hands, just needs to work more on getting separation from the DBs."
"2015-05-07 13:50:50","NFL_Draft","furthurr",3,"I love the post and there certainly is a tradeoff in selecting one position early over another. 

It would be interesting to examine this over the course of the coming years. A strategy like this may hurt the Vikings passing game in the short-term but the staff picked up a starting OLB, starting QB, a rotation end, and a 3rd down back last year rather than a WR. The only questionable pick is Chrichton but Zimmer loves to rotate defensive lineman to keep them fresh in his scheme so the pick definitely makes sense there. 

This year it seems the Vikings picked almost exclusively BPA throughout the draft. Trae Waynes was a great value pick for them since he was apparently very high on their big board. Sure, could have had Parker at the pick but you can't argue with BPA. 

2nd rounder was an awesome value in Erick Kendricks, immediate 3-down starter at OLB and reunited with his teammate Barr from UCLA. 

3rd rounder was once again a rotational edge rusher but I like Danielle Hunter's measurables and potential much more than Chrichton. This was an obvious BPA pick and another great value. 

So essentially the Vikings chose to shore up their defense in the last two drafts and add some contributing situational players so Zimmer can rotate depth rather than add a WR talent who is a potential improvement over, say, Patterson, Johnson, or Wright. 

The depth at WR is solid regardless. They'll have Wallace at the 1, Charles Johnson at the 2nd spot, and likely Wright/Patterson in the slot/backfield. Throw in Stefon Diggs from this draft and the Special Teams ace/local guy Thielen and it's a good, albeit not great corps. 

May have to look at who was available WR-wise at the more ""questionable"" picks over the last two years to see how significant the tradeoff was."

Let me just make sure I can understand how you're going about this though. Say for example the expected added value of a first round pick is 6 where 6 is a solid starter. Anything above that is considered a good pick, like say Aaron Rodgers is a 10 for ""HOF worthy"" so his value is clearly higher.

Cause if that's what you're saying it becomes pretty hard to judge still because I have to factor in injuries and off-field troubles for some players. It definitely sounds like a better method, but it seems like I'd have to do a lot more work and it would still come out pretty subjective in the end."

"2015-05-07 16:20:58","NFL_Draft","black_ravenous",2,"Green is definitely coming back and, barring a really great year, one of either Jones or Sanu will be back on a team-friendly deal. You mentioned Wright, and I think he's fantastic, but he probably peaks as a #3 receiver. I think the team is probably anticipating a breakout performance from one of the other receivers (Mario Alford, Cobi Hamilton, Denarius Moore). If one of those guys can get it together, the receiver position should be okay."
"2015-05-07 16:22:15","NFL_Draft","greebytime",2,"The actual production of each player is irrelevant to this discussion, it's just about what they were projected at and who decided to grab one of those top guys. 

The 49ers just used the 17th overall pick on a total prospect -- what if Armstead doesn't pan out? Same risk/reward as, say, DeVante Parker there. 

Where I (sadly) agree with what you are saying is that a stud WR isn't really part of the 49ers these days. While I and many other 49ers fans long for the day of Rice, Taylor, Owens, etc., right now it's not a pass-first offense. Therefore, it's unlikely that they'll prioritize WR too highly..."

"2015-05-07 23:58:16","NFL_Draft","Swag_Bro_420",2,"There's several things that make this difficult. The first is finding the data. Ideally, you'd want all of the combine scores of every player for at least 10-15 years. I'm not sure where you could get that.

The second is measuring success. If you had an objective measure of success for a position, you could find out how various traits correlate with that success. But there is no objective measure. Do you count starts? Pro bowls? Stats? How do you weight everything?

The third is the confounder of traits not in the combine. On average, I would expect players that are more athletic to be less polished in terms of technique. Players that are athletic and polished get drafted, athletic and raw get drafted, and players that are somewhat less athletic and polished get drafted, but players less athletic and raw don't get drafted. So the less athletic players would tend to be more polished coming out. This would be difficult to correct for, unless you had some way of measuring non-combine traits.

It may be possible to overcome these difficulties. There's probably already proprietary formulas that NFL teams keep secret."

"2015-05-08 00:03:26","NFL_Draft","ghostofmartyhurney",3,"&gt; too small to play linebacker

He's not to small to play linebacker. 6001, 230lbs, with 33"" inch arms is pretty much ideal for WLB, especially one that is going to play in coverage so much. And he has speed to play safety but it would require he drop down to about 220 or so. The Panthers use their linebackers in coverage better than anyone else in the league because it's something they value. It fits perfectly in that system. The linebackers are fast and fluid so that they can cover large zones. It's why they get away with having a less than stellar back end. They played 61% of their snaps in nickel last year. With Shaq, they will be able to play in their base set a lot more. A lot of teams are going with 11 personnel to get defensives in nickel, and then they run the ball with the advantage. If you have linebackers that can do banjo coverage or run down the seem with TE's and slot WR, then you can prevent matchups problems. That's how he fits."

"2015-05-08 01:03:50","NFL_Draft","atheist4thecause",4,"RB Corey Clement WISCONSIN -- I know fans of their teams say this all the time (and I am a Badgers fan) and it's not always warranted, but I do think it's warranted for me to say that Corey Clement is better than Melvin Gordon.

Gordon was a 3-star recruit and Clement is a 4-star recruit. Gordon was 6'1"" 185 lbs out of high school and the #25 RB while Clement was 5'11"" 217 lbs and the #6 RB.

Watching this guy, he is an absolute beast. People tell me all the time that it's due to his OL, but people fail to recognize that in the last year or two Wisconsin's OL was not what it once was. There was no 1st round OL last year, and they had just lost a bunch of top talent on the OL. They also fail to look at the actual plays to see that Clement is getting touched and running through multiple tackles (or making them completely miss).

I love the trait combination listed here: http://espn.go.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/150202/corey-clement

Power, elusiveness, and hands -- who doesn't love that combination? I know I do. And let me tell you, he shows every bit of all 3 of those on tape. In the open field he'll make a little move and the guy will completely miss him, but inside the tackles he runs right through arm tackles. For a power back (if that's what you want to call him, I guess he's balanced but I lean more towards power) to have his kind of wiggle and his kind of hands, that's special. I know I've shown this on other posts so you guys may have seen, but if you haven't, check out this highlights: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOvUnWh6X4

As you can see he has moves (nice stiff arm) and he is well-built. And I know those are highlights, but I promise you, I watched a lot of the Badgers and these runs became expected by our fan base because he did it so often. Heck of a highlight real for a backup, wouldn't you say? He's listed as the #4 RB in the 2017 NFL Draft class, but he's going to be moving up, and I do expect him to declare. Oh, and while we're at it, his production was 147 rushes for 949 yards and 9 TD's, and that production isn't because Gordon got hurt folks. (Btw, he had 67 attempts for 547 yards and 7 TD's as a Freshman.) He was held down to that much production and could have easily had 2000 yards IMO if he was the starter. Now throw on 14 receptions for 119 yards (the Badgers don't use RB's in the passing game much but you can see that he has the hands) for another 2 TD's. I can't wait for him to get the respect he deserves."

Malachi Dupre will be a star, too, and Diarse and Quinn are no slouches.

We have one of the best WR corps in the country, and we can't find  someone to throw the fucking ball. All we need is a game manager. Les Miles loves to find these athletes and shove them under center. We just need to find someone that can stand in the pocket, hand the ball off, and do a *semi-competent* job of throwing the ball like 15-20 times per game. That's all we need. It's impossible not to succeed, but somehow, our QB's always find a way."

He has pulled that Cal offense along kicking and screaming since he became the starter. He might not choose to leave school after his junior year, if so then he is also my top prospect for the 2017 NFL Draft.

I think that **Rashard Higgins** comes out of school early to enter the NFL Draft and is the number 1 WR prospect on boards. A ton of Garrett Grayson's production has to do with him becoming a reliable receiver at all levels.

Another guy I like a ton is the RB **Paul Perkins** out of UCLA. I'm not sold on him being the top RB prospect going into next year, but I would be shocked if he doesn't leave school early and doesn't get picked before round 3."

I like this example you made a lot. I've spent more time watching Randall than Rollins as an ASU fanboy, but there is no doubt that he is super versatile. With the number of blitz packages that Todd Graham runs on defense, he has to shift around a lot between playing safety and man coverage as a makeshift corner. And he is pretty darned good in both capacities despite the perceived deficits in his size."

Arm strength could be better, but it isn't everything. Progressions and reads can be fixed, it's really just the footwork that seems to be his major issue. Which is good, because that can also be fixed with good coaching. If he puts up similar numbers this year to the ones he did last season, I don't see why he wouldn't be a 1st round pick, assuming he doesn't get torn apart by scouts like Matt Barkley."

Cook's 2014: 3200 yards 24tds 8ints

Yes Cook had a better offensive line but his receiving core was a product of Cook's ability. He's lost his top 3 WRs and both starting RBs this year so if he can put up similar numbers he is a top 5 pick.

His line wasn't very good but he was sacked a total of 44 times, threw for 15ints, and a total of 9 lost fumbles. I don't see him being able to make good decisions in the NFL. Making a few good throws does not negate 44 sacks, 15ints, and a 9 lost fumbles. You can't turn the ball over like that in the Big Ten and expect to have better results in the NFL. If anything Hackenburg reminds me of a Mark Sanchez type of QB. Being poised means nothing if it doesn't translate to positive play being tough can only take you so far. Hack needs to take a big step forward to even get to Cooks current level. Cook has taken a step forward every game since becoming a starter and I have not seen that from Hackenburg.

Stats are basically useless when evaluating prospects, it's all about what you see on tape. Yes he turned the ball over quite a bit, but he was basically carrying that team so he was forcing the issue and trying to make plays he shouldn't. I do agree he needs to work on his accuracy, but I think it is part of his footwork issue. Some of his throws are perfect dropped between three defenders then the next is 5 yards over his receivers head. If he can get more consistent with his accuracy by fixing his footwork he is easily the best quarterback in this years class. He may not, but I am just saying what could be.

Cook is an excellent quarterback, but he isn't perfect. He doesn't handle interior pressure well and has a nasty habit of not stepping into his throws, even without pressure, that leads to inaccurate passes."

I don't know what kind of work he's putting in the offseason so I can't speak for him but if he plays anything like he did last year he's a second rounder at best. He has not really proven to be an NFL caliber QB thus far and that's what I'm grading him upon. Simply relying on ""potential"" and athletic ability won't get you far in the NFL. Decision making is the biggest part of the game and if you don't succeed at it at the collegiant level it's going to be that much harder in the pros.

Mario Pender isn't a known entity because he missed a season for injury and another for academic reasons. But he's probably the second best back in the ACC. Those two will share carries. Pender is just as natural a ball carrier with great instincts. He's bigger, stronger, faster than Cook, but not as elusive. The other is a 6'2, 230 bruiser named Jacques Patrick. 

Jimbo has always been a RB by committee guy. Ideally, Pender and Cook would each get 15 carries a game, and Patrick about 10. from my uninformed position at least. Cook will be the #1 back, but Pender is easily one of the best #2 backs in the country in that situation. Patrick is a freshman but that never stopped Jimbo, and he is a freak. 

As far as the OL, this next batch should actually be BETTER than the 5 guys in the NFL now (one last draft, 4 this one). That OL was patchwork. and were not allowed time to sit and develop. they all started as true freshman in a bowl game against ND a few years back. there also was no depth whatsoever.

Tre Jackson was a 2* (5th round)

Bobby Hart was a 4* (7th round)

Josue Matis was a 4* (undrafted free agent that signed day after the draft)

This second batch of OL for FSU has like seven or eight 4* recruits. They've had a couple years to develop, and Theyre bigger, more athletic, stronger, meaner. It'll take a bit to gel, but expect them to use basic, power blocking this season rather than the more complex zone scheme FSU's previous OL used. 

From the FSU fan POV, this next group of OL is objectively better than the last one in pretty much every way except experience, and projects to be a significant upgrade as early as the end of this season/next year. This is why FSU fans are licking their chops for the coming years, the talent, athleticism, and depth at the OL is just a totally different level than what we've had in Jimbo's tenure. 

I will say Dalvin got first contact in the backfield quite a bit, especially earlier in the year. The OL was a total mess until Cam switched to C to plug a gaping hole that was the freshman center. "

"2015-05-08 18:41:21","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"Consistency, accuracy, and footwork are all tied to each other. Improving his footwork will improve his accuracy and consistency. His decision making isn't really that bad, just forced. I am positive he doesn't make nearly as many forced throws behind Michigan State's offensive line. Again, I am not saying he is the top prospect now, just that he could easily be in a year. You really have to watch the tape on him to get why he is different than other ""potential"" quarterbacks. The way he maneuvers in the pocket, never rattles under pressure, and always has his eyes down field is very rare. It isn't all athleticism. "

I certainly think he has the potential to be a top pick for sure--I'm just not sold on what I've seen so far. 

Quick question though how much of his first year success was predicated on Bill O'Brien and Allen Robinson? Yes his line was bad last but is that going to be the excuse this year if he doesn't reach his potential. I understand a lot was asked of him but a lot is being asked of a Mariota or Bortles when they are thrown on to a TEN or JAX. "
"2015-05-08 19:14:28","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",2,"Bosa is likely the first non quarterback off the board so unless you guys really suck you probably won't get him, and if you do suck that bad you are likely taking a quarterback."

"2015-05-08 19:27:52","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"I think they were very good for him but not the reason for his success. If anything him losing his coach and going to a new scheme hurt him this year. I'm not worried about him dealing with pressure or anything like that, he's fantastic at it. The line is more of an excuse for his breakdown in mechanics than for his actual play. I feel like his mechanics would have improved more if he had more time. The only thing stopping him from being the first pick is footwork. If he can really work on it and fix it I think it will improve his accuracy tremendously. I get why you aren't sold on him, he was incredibly inconsistent with his accuracy last year and that absolutely needs to be improved. If he has another season like last year he's a late first guy, I just want to see some improvement this year so I know he gets it and has the capability to get better. If he does that then I'm comfortable taking him very early."
"2015-05-08 19:29:05","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"Maybe you can get Cardale and Elliott and get the Ohio State dream team."

"2015-05-08 19:33:35","NFL_Draft","rutgerswhat",2,"Definitely with you on that one. I think he's got the frame to tack on 10 pounds and not suffer too much from it. But yeah he looked closer to 175 at some points last year. "
"2015-05-08 19:34:25","NFL_Draft","BirdLaw_",1,"Being an Oregon fan, I'd say DeForest Buckner is pretty much the prospect that Armstead was hyped up to be, thought Buckner is quite a bit better than Armstead ever was for the Ducks. About the same size 6'6 290/295. He looks more athletic than Armstead on the field, and has the production that you'd want to see that you didn't get with Armstead (at least as far as a 2 gap 3-4 DE goes), comparing Armstead's 46 tackles, 5.5 TFL, 2.5 sacks last season to Buckner's 80 tackles 12.5 TFL, 4.5 sacks, as well as batting down 4 passes."
"2015-05-08 19:39:11","NFL_Draft","Burgerburgerfred",2,"I think if he addresses that one thing that I see as a major weakness which is his physicality and size for his height he would probably be right on Williams, Treadwell and Boyd's heels as the better set of Wide Receivers in this draft.

I've had him at a late first round grade since early last season just based purely on his hands and ability to get the football way up in the air, combined with a solid height speed combination.

"2015-05-08 19:54:05","NFL_Draft","BirdLaw_",2,"Yeah, hopefully he can get up to 195-200 by the time he heads to the combine without losing too much speed. I'd say 195 would be a little too light as well if he's 6'2, but I'd guess he's closer to 6'1 as well."
"2015-05-08 19:54:48","NFL_Draft","twjohns97",2,"You pointed out his run support being a positive, and that's one of my favorite things about him. He's small and not often that great of a tackler, but he's a high effort guy who won't shy away from wrapping up ball carriers. Putting more muscle on his frame could help improve his ability to tackle, but he's still a solid tackler for a corner his size. "
"2015-05-08 19:57:04","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"From the little I've seen of Boyd I would take Doctson in a heartbeat, not really that impressed with him at all."
"2015-05-08 19:58:33","NFL_Draft","Burgerburgerfred",1,"I haven't seen too much of anyone those are just the three I see as the general consensus 3 wideouts.

Doctson is one of the few I've truly watched a lot of after falling in love with him last season so I'm happy there is finally some hype and acknowledgement of talent coming his way."
"2015-05-08 20:00:54","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",2,"Yea I love his mentality as a tackler. He's not that small, but it seems he's got that little guy complex and hates being out muscled so it's like he takes it personal."
"2015-05-08 20:02:12","NFL_Draft","rockyroad99",1,"It's not just his footwork--it's his decision making that has to take big steps as well. 

If he has another year like last year and goes in the first he will be the first ever QB that gets drafted with more ints than tds in two straight seasons. I think he improves and has a 20 td 13int season. I don't see his interceptions taking a huge downturn while every aspect improves. 

I feel like picking a first round QB solely on ""potential"" is a recipe for  disaster. He has not justified a first round grade whatsoever. He showed that he struggled learning a new system with a suspect line. Which is very well what he may be up against in the NFL. 

I'm fine like a team like the Cowboys, Giants, Steelers, or Chargers taking him in the 2nd or 3rd and developing him under their current QB's but if Hackenburg would have been chosen this year and thrown on to Cleveland I believe he would have failed pretty hard."

"2015-05-08 20:08:43","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",6,"Very nice work, I had similar notes to what you had. His footwork is very impressive to me, the way he is constantly resetting so he is ready to throw is very Peyton-esque. The only issue I had with his mechanics are that his base looks too wide to me, but that shouldn't be too hard to fix. The only thing that really worries me about him as a prospect is that he needs to be more accurate and a better decision maker in the face of pressure. How he does in that area is what will decide if he is a top 10 pick or a 2nd rounder."
"2015-05-08 20:11:54","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"He does need to improve this year I agree. But I feel as though footwork is something that can be coached and improved so I expect, or at least hope, that he works on it a lot this year. He can be the top overall choice or a second rounder. It isn't just the physical talents that make him special though, it's the mental ones."
"2015-05-08 20:20:50","NFL_Draft","rockyroad99",1,"It's easier said than done Cook has been working with QB guru George Whitfield for a few years now and people still bitch about his footwork. I don't really understand how Hackenburg has special mental traits besides ""toughness"" which resulted into 44 sacks and 15 picks. His line sucks but he should have done a better job getting rid of the ball quicker and making the right decisions. For every great throw he made there's at least two that he didn't throw to a guy wide open."

Also, someone help: http://draftbreakdown.com/gif-embed/?clip=259687&amp;gif=LameEquatorialAmericanquarterhorse

In this gif is that an intentional pump fake or did he tip the corner cause his receiver wasn't ready?"
"2015-05-08 20:25:45","NFL_Draft","dseals",2,"Looks like Goff was supposed to hit the inside receiver as soon as he broke on the out route. You can see the receiver up top start blocking. Him not making that throw in time probably saved a pass interference penalty."
"2015-05-08 20:26:21","NFL_Draft","dseals",3,"I almost said he does the ""Peyton Manning happy dance"" but stopped short of calling it that. It is extremely similar though. I love his footwork."
"2015-05-08 20:28:01","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"His ability to maneuver in the pocket, keep his eyes downfield, and always look composed as things break down around him are the attributes I'm talking about. He also goes through his reads well. I don't recall seeing many open guys for him to throw to. He does need work, but if he fixes his footwork his accuracy should come. People bitch about Cook's footwork for a reason, he's still got accuracy issues of his own. More importantly, someone needs to break him of that nasty habit of throwing without stepping into his passes."
"2015-05-08 20:31:55","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"Yea it was the first thing that jumped out to me. I think the wide base issue is a reason for some of his softer passes, he probably can't get his lower half into it as much as he should."
"2015-05-08 20:42:08","NFL_Draft","axberka",1,"Except Ramsey is FSUs boundary corner next year "
"2015-05-08 20:48:03","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"Why did he play safety this year? Is he better suited there or just the lack of talent at safety you guys had this year?"
"2015-05-08 20:54:12","NFL_Draft","dseals",1,"I think the softer passes are mostly him taking something off the throw. I think narrowing his base would allow him to get a little more velocity on the throws, but I wouldn't try to change too much of it. Maybe just a slightly narrower stance. My real concern is how he goes sidearm when he's really wide."
"2015-05-08 21:01:26","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"I agree with you most of the time, but there were a couple instances where it looked like he could have used a bit more drive. The other think with the wide base is that it takes away from his height advantage. He has ideal size at 6'4 but with that stance he probably stands as tall as a guy who is 6'2. Though I think that is something that can be fixed."
"2015-05-08 21:07:15","NFL_Draft","duebex",2,"Great work, I'm a big fan of Goff as a prospect based on what I've seen of him.

Have you seen any of the other quarterbacks for next year? And if so, where do you think Goff ranks against the others? In my mind I believe he's better than Cardale right now, then Goff with Hackenberg and Cook slightly above that. "
"2015-05-08 21:08:57","NFL_Draft","dseals",1,"Right now I'd say Cook, Goff, Jones, and Hackenberg with some room to change. Hack's inconsistency is really killing my view of him whereas Cardale has the potential, Goff has his technique nailed, and Cook is an all-around good QB. This is basically a 1, 2, 3a, 3b type of ranking for the moment."
"2015-05-08 21:12:51","NFL_Draft","_b_e_n_",1,"Ramsey is a safety.. no?

Edit: Just saw he's playing corner this year. Anyone know why? He was awesome as a safety last year."
"2015-05-08 21:23:03","NFL_Draft","duebex",1,"Agree with Cook being the no1 so far - Hack is such a polarising talent, sometimes he's showing lots of issues with his accuracy whereas other times he's showing Andrew Luck-esque plays. I believe he'll bounce back from last season and the Penn State o-line did him no favours last year either. I really like Goff but I've seen so little of him compared to Cook/Hack, maybe that's why I don't have him as high as them two yet. "
"2015-05-08 22:16:02","NFL_Draft","IIHURRlCANEII",2,"The two Dlineman from Mizzou, Brantley and Augusta, could both be first round picks."
"2015-05-08 22:18:13","NFL_Draft","axberka",1,"Here is his full position and reasonings


FSU runs a 4-2-5 multiple defense 


Freshman season game 1: starts at field(I think it may have been boundary but either way he started at cb) 


Freshman season game 3-14: Tyler Hunter fractures his neck(or was it spine? Either way) so he gets moved to safety out of necessity and to put PJ(or it could've been darby whatever)



Sophomore season he actually played the star position that Joyner had occupied which serves as a nickel linebacker safety essentially that is used in a multitude of ways and is the cornerstone of the defense that we run, he blitzes, he stuffs the run, covers in man and covers in zone out of this defense so basically you have to be cut out of a very specific cloth(athletic enough to cover receivers, ""quick twitch"" enough to blitz, coverage ability to, and strong enough to stop the run all in one player)  to be effective at the star position. 


Back to the rest, the star position is very important and seeing as he fit that description he was put there. Well now that PJ and Darby are gone they need a starter at boundary and we have rising DB sophomore Trey Marshall who actually filled in  at linebacker very well against Georgia Tech due to injuries and is going to fill the star position. 

"
"2015-05-08 22:18:41","NFL_Draft","SilentSentinel",1,"Ronald Darby and PJ Williams were there, I don't think FSU has nearly the talent at CB that they had last season so he might be their best choice"
"2015-05-08 22:55:05","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"So would you say he's a better prospect at corner or safety? Right now as a safety he's probably the best in the class but as corner where would he go? He is certainly behind Hargreaves but is he better than Fuller or Sutton?"
"2015-05-08 22:58:28","NFL_Draft","axberka",1,"Safety he is very good, maybe elite as far as draft prospects go. 



We will have to wait and see. I'm sure he is an interesting prospect to teams cause he's extremely scheme versatile, cause he's excelled at safety, and for all intents and purposes at nickel, from reports from spring he has been ""embarrassing"" our receivers, and has been the best secondary player. Which is not saying much cause our receivers suck and so does our secondary lol"
"2015-05-08 22:59:16","NFL_Draft","776et",1,"I think it's because they lost Williams and Darby."

"2015-05-08 23:17:08","NFL_Draft","axberka",1,"Depends who you ask. Our starting safeties are Tyler Hunter(SS) and Nate Andrews(FS) 



Some fans blame Nate Andrews for some of our defensive woes last season and prefer Tyler Hunter. Others(such as myself) blame Hunter, look at all the biggest plays out defense gave up last season and you'll see Hunter jumping double moves and getting run past. But you'll have to see yourself, I think Andrews is worth a 2nd round at most and that's pushing it if he has a good year while Hunter shouldn't be drafted.  "

That really stood out to me in his game against USC where they were constantly getting pressure on him in the first half. He wasn't making clean reads, his technique suffered and his throws were erratic as a result.

If it's on the same level as his game against Colorado I could be convinced to change my opinion. However I'm looking at the Colorado game with a grain of salt since every single QB they faced burned them big time."

"2015-05-09 16:07:15","NFL_Draft","twjohns97",12,"Look what happened to Dominique Easley last year. I had him as a top 5 player and the best DT in the class, over Aaron Donald, but a torn ACL dropped him down to #30 to the Pats. If he recovers well, he's a steal. If he doesn't, the Patriots just wasted a first round pick. That's why we put so much stock into injuries. Even minor ones can really throw off a person's career if they get to the point where they are ""injury prone"" (looking at you, Knowshon Moreno). Injuries have to be taken into account because of the possibly effects. Now, freak injuries often don't matter that much, but when a person has chronic problems (Diggy and hips), teams have to respond. "
"2015-05-09 16:44:59","NFL_Draft","axle69",5,"Then you have the other end of the spectrum where guys like Gurley still go top 10. It's really all about whether a gm thinks the reward outweighs the risk or not. "

"2015-05-09 17:18:36","NFL_Draft","dseals",5,"Just to answer your question, if Fowler got hurt in pre-draft workouts he'd be lucky to be a day 2 pick. A guy that's going to pretty much miss his entire rookie year isn't worth a first or even third round pick. Smelter got the benefit of the doubt from the 49ers and got a 4th round pick spent on him. Fowler probably ends up in a similar spot as a 4th-5th round pick.

As often as injuries happen in football, and as someone who watches Arian Foster run with a clenched tight butthole, being able to stay healthy is a valuable trait in my book.

What happened to Fowler was a freak accident, but injuries are still injuries. If you would have told the Texans that Clowney is going to need microfracture surgery before the draft last year you bet your ass they, and every other team, pass on Clowney for a healthier player.

Taking a player with an injury or a history of injuries is a risk vs reward gamble. If you take the player and they never recover from their injury then you've just wasted a pick."

"2015-05-09 17:52:54","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",4,"Damn you guys are putting my preliminary scouting reports to shame.

I really think Ramsey should be a safety at the next level. If he comes out as a corner the best case scenario is he's the second guy off the board, and there is a good chance at least Fuller goes ahead of him. Do you agree or do you see him as a better corner at the next level?"
"2015-05-09 17:53:19","NFL_Draft","AKDMF447",2,"I remember watching the Mizzou game last year, noticed in cuz I was watching something else, but whenever I looked to see what was happening in that game, Hargreaves was making some sort of play, and I fell in love right there."
"2015-05-09 17:56:31","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",2,"I believe there was a play in that game that really impressed me and it was one where he got beat.

Somehow he still managed to recover and prevent the touchdown."
"2015-05-09 18:06:13","NFL_Draft","sio-kedelic",1,"Well, first, I think he is probably better at being both than anyone that was in this class. If he stays at CB, he has shown decent enough skills to me to be a good but undersized corner. He isn't perfect, but he shows good coverage skills that I think he would be fine. I agree that Fuller and Hargreaves are ahead of him, and I wouldn't be surprised if there was another corner or two that leaped him.

However, I love him at FS. He blitzes pretty well, is exceptional with backpedaling and off-man, and shows pretty good sideline skills. His hands aren't perfect, but they're good enough. I would like to see him play the run more like the second half than the first, though."
"2015-05-09 18:08:29","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"I think Collins is a huge boom or bust guy. Some games he looks like an elite prospect and others he looks like he can't find the ball to save his life.

"2015-05-09 18:14:42","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",4,"He's listen at 6'1, so I don't know if I would call him undersized. But I do agree, at corner he probably goes behind those two at least. I think as a safety he is a top 10 player and the best to come out in a few years. But either way he's got versatility that teams love as he can play either position. I think how he does at corner this year will determine where teams view him."
"2015-05-09 18:32:10","NFL_Draft","enfyte416",4,"I think it depends a lot more on talent level than you let on. Maybe this is just a 49ers thing but they drafted Brandon Thomas in the 3rd round even though he tore his ACL very close to the draft and had no chance of playing his first year. In a weak draft class, a perceived top 5 caliber guy is probably still going in the second or third round if he injures himself pre-draft. "
"2015-05-09 18:38:22","NFL_Draft","sio-kedelic",1,"100% agree. I hope some of Florida State's other CBs can step up after Williams/Darby got drafted so he stays at FS and continues to kick ass."
"2015-05-09 19:11:50","NFL_Draft","rqebmm",2,"I think scouts and GMs put a little too much stock into them because they cut their teeth in an era when a torn ACL was a career ending injury. The more forward thinking GMs have recently been spending more and more draft picks on guys with recent injuries, hoping to get a big payoff. It's certainly never a given that a guy will recover 100%, but draft picks are already a crap shoot. In the case of an injured player you're losing development time on the field and in the weight room, which is a big deal. This cost varies wildly depending on the severity of the injury as well as how pro-ready the player is. If you think he needs a year or two of seasoning, and he'll lose at least one year to rehab, that could be a deal breaker, wheras if you think he's pro-ready and needs two months, maybe it doesn't affect his stock.

But with that said, modern medicine has made a lot of injuries a mere bump in the road, and if you and your team's doctors think a guy is able to make a full recovery, then it's possible to get a steal. It's also worth noting that the teams that have been taking a lot of chances on injured guys have world-class medical communities (Boston, SF, and now Philly). I know the Red Sox came out at one point and said they felth their biggest non-money edge was the doctors in Boston letting them profit from oft-injured players like Mike Napoli and Shane Victorino.

One interesting wrinkle is something I heard aboue Dominique Easley last year: if a guy already had a major injury in college and recovered, some teams might actually feel BETTER about his chances for recovery from a second injury. Obviously you have to weigh that against the odds that he'll have more down the line, but another factor to consider is the mental toughness it takes to recover from a debilitating injury like an ACL tear."
"2015-05-09 19:19:34","NFL_Draft","dseals",1,"Well if we're going with the weak draft class argument Fowler still probably falls to day 4. I mean if Diggy can be a 3rd round pick because of his hips and the depth at edge rusher then I don't see why Fowler wouldn't fall farther."
"2015-05-09 19:30:47","NFL_Draft","lol_What_Is_Effort",2,"&gt; if Fowler got hurt in pre-draft workouts he'd be lucky to be a day 2 pick

I don't think I agree with this. Just look at Brandon Thomas, G from Clemson. He was a fringe day 1 pick IIRC, and tore his acl in a pre-draft workout. Ultimately, Thomas was selected in the third round of the draft. 

Fowler was a top-5 talent in the draft without a doubt, and even with an ACL tear, he would go around where Gregory was picked without a doubt. Considering how well most guys come back from an ACL now, nabbing a top-5 talent in the second would be just too great of a value to pass up, especially considering that it is not uncommon for second rounders to not contribute for a year or two."
"2015-05-09 19:39:57","NFL_Draft","dseals",1,"Because the offensive line talent in this draft wasn't great, but the edge rushing talent was. Oh Fowler got hurt in pre-draft workouts and definitely won't contribute his first year and is a bit of a question mark going forward? Well then I'll take Vic Beasley, or Bud Dupree, or Preston Smith, or Randy Gregory, or Shane Ray. There was plenty of talent at Fowler's position in this draft which would easily have caused him to fall if not to day 3 then at least the 3rd. If Diggy can fall to the third because of bad hips then a player with a recently torn ACL shouldn't be going any higher than the 3rd.

Fowler being a top 5 talent isn't going to give him a special pass here. Teams are still looking at risk vs reward. The only reason Gurley was a top 10 pick was because his injury wouldn't limit his playing time in his first season."
"2015-05-09 19:50:54","NFL_Draft","enfyte416",1,"Using the Diggy logic, Ogbuehi should have been drafted in the 4th round or later.  

Diggy was flagged because he has needed repeated hip surgery. It's completely different. Fowler was never injured during college and this was a random freak injury. Teams have proved by drafting Thomas in the third and Ogbuehi in the 1st that they aren't as scared of knee injuries as they used to be. With guys like Thomas Davis and AP coming back strong they know it's not something that can be career threatening like it used to be.

"2015-05-09 20:05:11","NFL_Draft","enfyte416",1,"Well you said ""even with the weak draft class argument"" so I gave you an example of someone right out of this draft class. Todd Gurley is yet another guy. Both him and Ogbuehi will be healthy before Fowler is at this point but my point is teams aren't afraid of a one off ACL tear. I think Ogbuehi would have gone in the first regardless. If a guy is that talented he doesn't fall very far unless teams check him out and see something really serious. I'd be much more afraid of a potentially recurring hip injury than a one time knee injury. "

"2015-05-09 20:15:48","NFL_Draft","dseals",1,"Gurley also wasn't injured late in the season. The Rams taking him is still a big gamble because of his injury history. Maybe I'm just insane, but I'd rather have a guy that can contribute right away in the first instead of someone who will miss a large part of the season due to any injury. The first is where you get the instant impact guys and the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th is there for those high risk high reward players imo.

I don't understand why you would take a risk on a player in the 1st even with the advances in injury recovery. Even if the player recovers fully (which let's not forget isn't fully guaranteed) you're still losing a year of that player's time and possibly missing out on a player that can contribute immediately."
"2015-05-09 20:22:08","NFL_Draft","enfyte416",1,"Don't get me wrong, if you are talking about a guy with no injury history vs a guy who has an ACL tear I take the first one, but if you compare him to a guy like Diggy who has recurring injuries or Clemmings who I still imagine was flagged for something, I'll take the ACL guy any day of the week. Despite not being able to do anything day 1, those first round players are also long term investments. It's the same logic as taking a QB top 10 and sitting him for a year. The talent is too much to justify not taking him even if he can't play right away. "

"2015-05-09 21:36:11","NFL_Draft","lol_What_Is_Effort",2,"&gt;Because the offensive line talent in this draft wasn't great

Brandon Thomas was picked by the 49'ers in the 2014 draft. Besides, the issue with the majority of the edge rushers in this draft is that they were all fairly flawed prospects in some way: Beasley has size/run defense concerns, Dupree is super raw, Gregory has drug and personality concerns, and Shane Ray had similar drug and arrest concerns. 

Fowler was the most well-rounded rusher in the draft, and didn't have any chronic issues, unlike Odighizuwa. His injury was an accident that does not appear to be a pattern at this point. Even Dominique Easley had multiple ACL tears, needed to effectively redshirt this year, and still managed to be a first round selection. I don't really see picking an injured Fowler in the first as any different from taking a quarterback with the intention of sitting him for a year or two, aside from the difference in positional value (which is a valid potential argument).

"2015-05-09 22:22:30","NFL_Draft","dseals",1,"Well first off Fowler had run stopping and rawness concerns as well. He wasn't the consensus #1 edge rusher by any means.

And that's the argument I'm going to use because you're out of your mind if you think drafting an injured DE, or any position really, compares to drafting a QB in the first to have them sit a year. That QB still provides a valuable addition to the roster right away and can take over whenever they are ready like Bortles and Bridgewater did. You can find healthy DEs that can still contribute immediately in place of Fowler. He wasn't a Clowney or Mario Williams type of special. He was a good DE in a class full of them. Had he been injured in a pre-draft workout I'm almost certain he's not a first round pick anymore.

I still wouldn't take him until the third at least, but I think it's clear from this that I'm a minority on this issue."

I ended up watching about six games from Miami last year while scouting their seniors.

I like his mobility, but it'll be interesting to see how his pocket presence develops without his starting LT and RG."

Secondly, his problem was almost definitely the severity of his injury and how teams think he will recover and not his talent. I bring up Brandon Thomas once again. He was considered a 2nd round talent at best, and didn't have nearly the hype that someone like Ifo had, and he was drafted in the third round despite tearing his ACL *months later* in the process than Ifo did.

On top of that, all four teams in the division improved through the draft,  if anything, the falcons improve more.  "
"2015-05-11 14:37:41","NFL_Draft","DoctorWhosOnFirst",5,"You don't have to buy it, but saying ""magically"" is just silly.  There were concrete steps taken.  You can disagree with the ultimate impact, of course; but it's not like either team didn't do anything to improve their bad defenses, which is what you said.

And that was wrong."
"2015-05-11 14:56:30","NFL_Draft","JohnnyFire",2,"I actually quite like Floyd. Main knock is his size but I think he's coachable and can succeed as a pro (from what limited bits I saw of him) if he adds 5-10 pounds of muscle."

I guess it doesn't help that the worst records in the league are 5-11. That tends to lend itself to a lot of parity, but it's totally unrealistic. "
"2015-05-11 15:10:23","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",3,"Well if his measurements are correct he needs more than 5-10, but he looks to have the frame that adding muscle so I'm not worried about that. My main concern with him is his instincts, especially in the run game, looked lacking. The weight and technique are fixable, I'm not sure that is. However with his length and athleticism he is likely a first rounder, it just remains to be seen where."
"2015-05-11 15:12:30","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"I mean I'm used to seeing receivers being lazy in run blocking, but for the speed that this guy has when he turns on the jets, I watch him and he looks like he's jogging through half his routes.

"2015-05-11 15:24:44","NFL_Draft","776et",1,"I think the defense needs a few years. We are switching to a 3-4, so it will take some time to get the right personnel for that system. I like the offense a little more, but I think we'll see a lot more turnover as we continue to improve our o-line and maybe part ways with players like Martellus Bennett and at some point Cutler.

Dak Prescott* QB Mississippi State  
**Cardale Jones* QB Ohio State** - We know who this is. Beloved local QB, big motherfucker, raw as all hell but has potential.  
**Christian Hackenberg* QB Penn State** - The prototype for 2015; pro-style, does little things well, coachable, ""Andrew Luck Lite"" if he gets it right.  
Kevin Hogan* QB Stanford  
Trevone Boykin* QB TCU  
Cody Kessler* QB USC  
Brandon Doughty* QB Western Kentucky

Jake Brendel* C UCLA  
Max Tuerk* C USC  
Zach Banner* OT USC  
Jordan Simmons* OG USC  

**Big Bodied TE**  
Hunter Henry* TE Arkansas - 6'5"", 250 lbs, and he uses that size to his utmost advantage. [Kind of looks like Adam Devine from Workaholics](http://media.247sports.com/Uploads/Recruit/156/229701.jpg)  
Nick Vannett* TE Ohio State  
Pharoah Brown* TE Oregon - Take away the injury and he'd be sniffing the first round. Also, local boy from Lyndhurst.  
Evan Engram* TE Ole Miss  
Austin Hooper* TE Stanford  

**Pass Rush Completion**  
Johnathan Allen* EDGE Alabama  
**Scooby Wright III* OLB Arizona** - His name is Scooby. I kind of want to draft him.  
**Shawn Oakman* DE Baylor**  - This man is the incredible hulk. He is raw but is also gifted in all the ways Arik Armstead was not. Could be scary good.  
Bronson Kaufusi* EDGE BYU  
**Leonard Floyd* EDGE Georgia** - Undersized but has a lot to like in terms of what he could be coached to become; if he gets little things right, could be great.  
Jordan Jenkins* EDGE Georgia  
Luke Knott* LB Iowa State  
**Devonte Fields* EDGE Louisville**  
**Shilique Calhoun* EDGE Michigan State**  - Went back to school, but probably a 2015 first rounder to some. Oozes pro-level talent, imo.  
**Joey Bosa* DE Ohio State** - Considered to be the DE Beast of this draft in terms of being an all-around player.  
Joshua Perry* OLB Ohio State  
**Robert Nkemdiche* DE Ole Miss** - Has become a consensus top DE in terms of potential for pass rush, per most pundits.

Jake Replogle* EDGE Purdue  
Skai Moore* LB South Carolina  
Myles Jack* OLB UCLA  
Dadi Nicolas* EDGE Virginia Tech  

**Dear God, Not Billy Cundiff Ever Again**  
Roberto Aguayo* K Florida State - May have been the only name worth drafting even if he went out this year. Solid K, surprising power and accuracy.  "

"2015-05-11 16:25:31","NFL_Draft","dseals",2,"Oh no, Boyd is worse for sure. I can't find it, but I remember one play where the commentator praised Boyd on his curl route and when it was zoomed it on Boyd you could see him round out the curl and take 2 or 3 extra steps to stop. I audibly laughed."

In my scouting report I wrote that he just doesn't have as much speed as people seem to think he does. He honestly doesn't look that fast on tape. I don't think he is going to create separation with his speed, which is why fixing up his route running is imperative. 

As far as whether he can fix his route running, i think people just need to look right at his hips. I've never seen him sink his hips when he gets into his break. "

"2015-05-11 23:56:26","NFL_Draft","enfyte416",1,"Dude I noticed the same thing about Goff not sensing pressure coming from his strong side, but it seems to only happen when he is looking left. I think he just doesn't feel pressure well in general but that's just me. 

Speaking of looking left, I noticed that he seems to have some serious issues when he throws that way. His hips open up way too much and he extends his left leg outward instead of forward when he throws and it seems to lead to him pushing the ball much further to the left then he intends to throw it. I rarely see him succeed when trying to throw to the left side. "

"2015-05-12 00:01:16","NFL_Draft","atheist4thecause",8,"&gt; I think you are going to have people arguing with you because you are blaming the whole patriots organization based on the actions of 3 people.

The Patriots are responsible for what their employees do. It is really as simple as that. If employees cheated, the Patriots cheated. The employees are representative of the organization they work for. It's up to the team to hire good people, to create a culture of non-cheating in place, and create proper procedures in place to protect against this kind of think. If you think about it, how dumb would it be to say that Tom Brady cheated, but the Patriots didn't cheat? I mean, that would be absolutely idiotic.

&gt; You are arguing that the Patriots organization deserves this

They do.

&gt; and that Robert Kraft was ""caught cheating"" when there is 0 basis for any of that.

I did not say Robert Kraft was caught cheating. An organization is not merely their owner. Think about it. If Tom Brady rushes for a TD, people say the Patriots scored a TD and nobody says, ""No, the Patriots didn't score a TD, Tom Brady scored a TD."" People would obviously say that Tom Brady scored as a more detailed explanation, but Brady definitely represents the team, as does every employee the organization employs."

Why not? You could simply call it negligence on the part of the Patriots to have allowed this to happen. The employees represent the organization, so it's acceptable to punish the organization for what their employees did.

&gt; Going to the other scandals, are you honestly going to try to tell me that this is more serious than Bountygate or Spygate? It's frankly not even close.

No. If you read what I wrote you will see that I'm showing a history of cheating by the Patriots here. It's kind of interesting how you use Spygate to try and show that Deflategate is a non-issue. The Patriots do not get a pass for having something worse in their recent history. In fact, Spygate only adds onto what Deflategate is because of repeated behavior.

&gt; I would've been fine with a 4 game suspension for Brady

Well at least you don't have a complaint there and you acknolwedge that Tom Brady is a cheater. Now you just need to acknowledge that as the QB of the Patriots, he represents the team, and that makes the entire team responsible.

&gt; disappointed in the NFL for blindly following public opinion

You keep saying this, but the public outcry wasn't even that bad. A lot of the media and fans of other teams were saying this was a non-issue. The NFL certainly did not give into public pressure. Even after, the articles are all about how severe the punishment is. If the expectation was that the Patriots would lose a 1st and then some, this would not be considered severe. The expectation by the public/media was that the Patriots might not even lose a pick, and that's what makes this seems so severe. Nice try, though.

&gt; Docking the team's picks is inane

You can say that all you want, but it's perfectly reasonable.

&gt; I'm not a Patriots fan.

Well then you are a perfect example of how the public outcry is not what you say it is.

&gt; What I am a fan of is fair proceedings, and this case was anything but that.

"2015-05-12 00:31:03","NFL_Draft","atheist4thecause",4,"&gt; Also, tell me when and where Brady said to lower it illegaly

It was right around the time that Brady was having long conversations with those people he didn't know.

&gt; What part of that is false.

That is nothing but snippets, and it does not prove the investigation as flawed, which leads to believe that the 3rd Party conclusion is also correct, which was that tampering occurred. Your little image attempts to pick out the smallest snippets in a very long report with no context to lead to different conclusions, but they are not significant enough to put the whole investigation into question, or the conclusion. There are always question marks in investigations about the past. It really makes me sick that a fan would put their team above the league and sport like this. If that image is the best you have then I suggest looking a little harder at all of the information."

"2015-05-12 01:09:11","NFL_Draft","enfyte416",2,"Tom Brady scored because his team was blocking for him. Hence ""The Patriots scored."" There are 10 other people on the field all trying to do the same thing, an organization that bought those players and put him in front of Brady, Coaches who designed the play. They were all involved. That is where your argument falls short. Three people went rogue in order to set this in motion and they were not supported by the team, the coaches, or the owner. Why should I say the Patriots cheated when it was actually only Tom Brady that cheated? 

And I get that employees represent their owners and stuff like that but if you look at it that way it also makes Goodell hypocritical. You're saying you are okay with Goodell fining the Patriots Organization even though they had no knowledge of the event, while he himself used the excuse of not seeing the tape when he made the mistake of giving Ray Rice only 2 games.

"2015-05-12 01:28:36","NFL_Draft","atheist4thecause",6,"&gt; Tom Brady scored because his team was blocking for him.

You don't seem to understand how this works. I think you are purposefully being vague to protect the Patriots. Look how you use ""his team"" when talking about blocking. But what/who does the blocking? The answer is that the individual lineman and TE's, who are individual people that also represent the team just as Tom Brady does, make up the blocking. The team is not a person, even though you try to treat the team as a person. The team is made up of these individual employees, owners, and then there are some paperwork documents.

&gt; That is where your argument falls short. 

No it doesn't. Not everybody on the team has to have done something wrong in order for the team to be punished. Now you are truly being ridiculous.

&gt; Three people went rogue

This is a positive claim you cannot prove. Also, even if 3 employees went rogue, as representatives of the team, the team is responsible for them.

&gt; Why should I say the Patriots cheated when it was actually only Tom Brady that cheated?

If you want to say each individual cheated then do that. The team still deserves every bit of punishment as the team. Also, saying that the team cheated does not mean that each individual on the team cheated, and most people understand that. The only people who don't are the ones that have an agenda, and your agenda here is to protect the Patriots.

&gt; And I get that employees represent their owners and stuff like that but

So what's the problem? You get that the cheaters represent the owner and the team. So why don't you get why the Patriots lost a 1st Round draft pick (and more)?

&gt; but if you look at it that way it also makes Goodell hypocritical.

This should be interesting.

&gt; You're saying you are okay with Goodell fining the Patriots Organization even though they had no knowledge of the event, while he himself used the excuse of not seeing the tape when he made the mistake of giving Ray Rice only 2 games.

Lol. Well, that was certainly interesting. I never said that for one. I never implied or inferred it, either. If you follow the line of logic I used you definitely do not come to that conclusion. lol Well, I was expecting something interesting but you truly topped my expectations. Well done, sir. And to point the finger now at the Ray Rice situation... *facepalm*

&gt; No part of that makes any sort of sense.

Well, you got that right. Nothing of what you just said about Ray Rice and the punishment makes sense in the context of this conversation.

&gt; He is abusing his own powers as a Commissioner.

Secondly, The point of me saying that the team blocks for him, despite the fact that they are individuals, they all are trying to accomplish one thing. That's what makes them a team. That's why when ""The Patriots"" score, it's not just Tom Brady, it's the whole team. They all united to achieve one purpose, which was scoring a touchdown. 

The thing you missed is that the whole Patriots team and organization did not unite in their attempt to cheat.

By virtue of being an NFL team, they are subject to the NFL's imposed rules, for better or worse, which means that obstruction of what the commissioner is trying to do is absolutely punishable and does not have to stem from a legal right for it to be applicable. 

FYI, the Wells report came to the level of conclusion necessary to convict in a civil trial, so its well beyond just speculation, assuming you want to go off of a well documented standard. 

There are many legitimate qualms one can have on this particular subject, but these are not among them. If you wanted to argue that Wells wasnt an impartial investigator, thats a legitimate qualm that I would agree with.

There is no cherry picking in such a black and white case, one based on science. Either the science is true or we've been doing the ideal gas law wrong for a long while now. What was done was nothing more than point out a miscalculation or faulty data piece in a math problem, anyone who has ever done lab science can attest to that. However, this not being a math problem, there is no half credit for your work before and after the mistake. If the report was based on a flawed premise I see no reason why it is legitimate. If you look at the report from the premise of the only scientifically possible then we did nothing possibly classified as cheating, save the possible interference report but even that was advised to Brady by the nflpa.

Yeah, basically, for every ball testing the one was lower than the other consistently, except on one ball, which he was slightly higher on. And this is what the image is using to try and prove Brady didn't tamper. It's a joke.

&gt; This is not cherrypicking but science. Its pretty straightforward from their

See what you are doing here? You are saying, ""This is science, therefore, Brady didn't tamper."" You also took me way out of context by saying it's not cherry-picking. Your image is absolutely cherry-picking. This was 200+ pages worth of information and it's taking like 5 sentences throughout the entire document to make this little point, which even if it is shown to have merit, still not show that Brady didn't tamper. In fact, what they are really trying to do is put the investigation in question more than anything, and they don't come close to showing that the investigation was flawed at all. By taking the side of the Patriots, you are not just disagreeing with the NFL, you are disagreeing with a 3rd party team of investigators/investigation. And when you and others try to say that this investigation was a sham, you are putting the reputation of that investigator on the line.

I would suggest looking at the rest of the facts, which also include science. Look at the phone records and then look at Brady saying he doesn't even know these guys. How is he having extended conversations with people he doesn't know? That right there is some of the most damning evidence someone could have. And then the Patriots refused to help outside of their lying. If they were innocent they would have handed over their information easily, but after the investigators did get a hold of the information anyways, it showed that they were being lied to. So you have two options: Believe this cherry-picked image with maybe a paragraph of total content out of a 200+ page document along with a known former cheating organization that has been penalized for it that clearly lied in this investigation or believe a 3rd party 200+ page document with one of the most reputable investigators known (and this was stated by many going into the investigation, not just after) that shows tampering clearly occurred and proved Brady to be a liar. Take your pick on which side you want to believe, but if you put your bias aside, this is a very clear cut investigation. Brady cheated and lied and put the careers of many at stake to get a benefit. Others were involved in this as well. The Patriots as a hole and Robert Kraft was involved in stifling the investigation. Seriously, it's not hard to figure out what happened here and people saying that Wells ran a sham investigation are absolutely despicable."

"2015-05-13 01:06:10","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",7,"He is pretty strong but I don't know if I would say he's scarily strong. I really thought he was misused in the middle of that Ole Miss defense, he gets blown off by double teams. Right now I think he is a top 5 player in this class with how quick he comes off the ball and explodes into the backfield, but there is a clear gap between him and Bosa and Hargreaves, who I think are the top two guys in this class by a decent margin.

Also as far as your example goes, I don't necessarily think that was a bad play on his part. The defense end should have outside contain there and allows the running back to beat him, Nkemdiche pursues and forces the runner back inside. You see his head look to the sideline and nobody is out there. I actually think that was a pretty heads up football move, and if the linebacker does his job that is a minimal gain."

"2015-05-13 01:10:06","NFL_Draft","Dizzy2294",1,"depends on how the coaches want their defense done. personally, my old defense I was told to force every thing outside but most defenses like to force things to cut back inside.

"2015-05-13 01:11:40","NFL_Draft","_b_e_n_",1,"Ah ok that makes sense. I thought the end would be responsible for that part of the field and the outside linebackers taking the outside.

"2015-05-13 01:12:59","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",2,"That is strange, I've honestly never heard that philosophy. But yea, I think Nkemdiche made a pretty good play there, if the linebacker doesn't over pursue and try to race to the sideline instead of letting Nkemdiche force him back in then it's a two yard gain. The end and linebacker made the bad plays there. "
"2015-05-13 01:20:42","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",2,"Generally for most defenses the end has outside contain to funnel it back inside for the linebackers. When the end loses it you can see Nkemdiche run hard to get in front on the running back. Normally the linebacker would be the one trying to get outside, but in that situation he should have had the awareness to see his teammate had the outside and pursued a bit more carefully to prevent that cutback run. I think that play was more on the end and linebacker the Nkemdiche.

the whole defense was based on this for outside runs where the fullback or a pull guard would attack the sam. so spilling it took a blocker completely out and trying to force the RB to run East West while the Mike gets over the top based on his read.

I think he has a pretty solid release for being in college, and he has taken snaps from shotgun and behind Center.

I also think Cook has gotten everything out of that Michigan St offense, because it wasn't exactly loaded with talent. Their top offensive talent in the 2015 NFL Draft was their RB that went in the 4th Round. WR's Lippett and Mumphery went in the 5th Round. So, I guess I will go with Cook for now.

There are a couple of guys that I could see becoming really good if they develop this year, so I wouldn't be surprised at all if it becomes a strong QB year.

So you're talking about a guy 3 inches taller than Julius Peppers and 10 lbs heavier or 2 inches taller than Mario Williams. And really, in order to pull that off he has to be comparable athletically, so do you think he's going to test like Mario Williams did?"
"2015-05-13 10:46:50","NFL_Draft","Philliefan12",1,"I think this comes down to hackenberg. He looked great in his freshman year, and then had to take a step back last year due to the constant pressure he was under, the nonexistence of a run game, and playing under the 2nd new offense in 2 years. All of these problems will be fixed for him this year as he has more experience with the offense and PSU's young offensive line from last year has improved significantly, so this should be the year that he reassures himself as the number 1 guy. But if he doesn't, there are no excuses for him."

He's only a junior this year, so he could very well end up staying and waiting for 2017 anyway, but he has absolutely ideal size that may only get better as he bulks up, a pretty strong arm with a fairly quick snap release, pretty good short/intermediate accuracy, and seems to be excellent in his decision-making, both pre- and post-snap. He definitely seems like a pocket passer, but he shows enough skills to shuffle in the pocket to elude pressure that he isn't a statue or anything.

He was stuck behind Nick Marshall or he would've been the starter last year, but he played that first half against Arkansas when Marshall was suspended and looked unbelievably sharp doing so. Marshall did okay against the defense in the second half, but this Auburn offense looked even better with Johnson back there. I'm really excited to see Johnson and Duke Williams together this year."
"2015-05-13 13:54:58","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",2,"Very impressive arm there, but that footwork needs a lot or work. He definitely has massive talent, but I think he is likely a 2017 guy."

"2015-05-13 19:19:40","NFL_Draft","enfyte416",1,"That sounds like a billion other players too. The point is If he does get better he will be a high pick. It also didnt help that there was a lot of turnover at Penn state

"2015-05-13 19:30:59","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"Assuming we are just talking defensive line prospects there is Vernon Gholston, Gaines Adams, and Jamaal Anderson in the last few years. Now Oakman is definitely more gifted than them, but there is no guarantee he will be a star either. I am not contesting his validation as a top 10 pick as I have him in the teens, but I don't think he can be considered over a guy like Bosa who has good athletic traits as well as good technique."
"2015-05-13 19:34:08","NFL_Draft","EonKayoh",1,"Gholston &amp; Adams weren't elite athletes.  Anderson was, I'll give you that.

"2015-05-13 19:41:01","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"Yes then that is an excellent comparison."
"2015-05-13 19:46:15","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",5,"I haven't gotten to next years prospects at all yet, but compared to last year this class is much more talented. Hargreaves would have been the first corner taken last year if he was a freshman, he has been that good. Bosa and Nkedmiche are likely off the board before any of last years defensive lineman. Tunsil and Staley would have been top 5 choices and are much better than the tackles last year. Jalen Ramsey is easily the best safety prospect of either year. Myles Jack and Scooby Wright are both better players than Shaq Thompson and are probably both gone by 20."
"2015-05-13 20:09:13","NFL_Draft","enfyte416",1,"I have Oakman slotted as a 3-4 DE also. I just think there is too much leverage involved in being an EDGE guy in a 4-3 and Oakman is just too tall to make it work. He offers so much more as a 5 tech. "

Donald probably would have been rated higher by others if he wasn't so undersized. 

I don't think you really got shit on, people just disagreed with you there. When you did your mock I remember the general reaction was positive because it was different."
"2015-05-13 21:25:42","NFL_Draft","EonKayoh",1,"The mock, sure, but the thread I posted asking why Leonard Williams was a top 10 pick was met with a shitton of vague criticism."

"2015-05-13 22:11:27","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"See I feel the opposite. Cook has a few accuracy issues but nowhere near as bad. When he misses it's by a couple feet now a couple yards. But when Hackenberg is on he looks like Andrew Luck."
"2015-05-13 23:44:28","NFL_Draft","mistermister321",3,"I think to be completely honest Connor Cook is by far the most NFL-ready QB in this draft class, Hackenburg has by far the highest ceiling, and Jones as the best physical tools but i see Jamarcus Russell in him sometimes based on his behavior. In all think there are 4-5 starting QBs in this draft class(Hackenburg,Jones,Cook,Goff, and Kessler) and plenty of serviceable backups, and I think Cook will be to this draft what Andrew Luck was to the 2012 draft "
"2015-05-13 23:49:58","NFL_Draft","TheThirdLevel",4,"That's pretty high praise. Luck was pretty much a transcendental prospect and a clearcut #1 overall pick. 

I think Cook is more like a Jameis Winston type of prospect - a known commodity coming from a pro-style offense with good athleticism. Less off-field issues compared to Jameis, but not as much of a threat on the ground either. Excellent college production for both. Cook is maybe a little safer with less high of a ceiling. 

Also worth noting that Cook hasn't been surrounded by elite skill players either. Langford was a solid RB who went in the 4th round. Our best WR Lippett was a 5th rounder and split his time at CB later on. We've got a few guys coming back who aren't really on the NFL radar yet either. Only other sure NFL picks he has on that offense are his LT Conklin and his C Allen. "
"2015-05-13 23:52:28","NFL_Draft","2PacTookMyLunchMoney",2,"Connor Cook most definitely has a cannon. He has some of the best arm strength of any QB prospect in awhile. He's right up there with Cutler and Stafford (as draft prospects) in that regard.

I didn't see you mention it, but his biggest knock is easily his footwork. He flashes the ability to move around the pocket properly, but he falls away from pressure more often than not, which is a VERY big no-no."
"2015-05-14 00:08:10","NFL_Draft","TheThirdLevel",2,"No way. He's got plenty of arm but he is definitely not in the Stafford/Cutler category, or at least he has not showed that on a consistent basis yet.

"2015-05-14 00:10:45","NFL_Draft","TheThirdLevel",1,"He does tend to hang on to the ball too long though.

"2015-05-14 14:33:16","NFL_Draft","dfo90",2,"Re: Jets and Williams: LW was an elite prospect who fell and few teams would have been able to resist going BPA under those circumstances.

DLINE is a critical unit. The same way ""it begins in the trenches"" on offense, the same can be said about defense. An elite DLINE makes the whole defense better. You also can't have enough DTs, specifically. Most teams rotate a lot at DT to keep the big guys fresh. An elite DLINE needs at least three greats DTs.

Edit: To add, this is also the common justification for the Dolphins picking DT Jordan Phillips in the 2nd round despite signing Suh and having seemingly bigger needs elsewhere."
"2015-05-14 14:41:23","NFL_Draft","themoplainslife",1,"Ok gotcha thanks. It just seemed a little odd to me because of how much other talents were available at the time. So maybe DT is unique in that it you have to have a whoooole lot of them to have too many. "
"2015-05-14 14:44:09","NFL_Draft","dfo90",2,"In my opinion, at least. I'm sure good cases can be made against it. Their new HC Bowles is a defensive guy too, which could have influenced the pick as well."

"2015-05-14 14:52:06","NFL_Draft","down42roads",3,"&gt; Why was their such disparity on how good of a prospect Bud Dupree is?

He was a very raw product. Outstanding physical traits, but poor technique which led to lower production. Some teams (and some analysts) favor polish over potential.

&gt;What happened with Malcolm Brown that he fell to 32?

His best fit is as a 4-3 NT/1 tech, which is a low value positio for many teams.

&gt;Lastly, do you think Marcus Peters character concerns will follow him into the NFL?

I don't like the term ""character concerns"" for his situation. It was more of a maturity issue. The Washington coaching staff went from Sarkisian (inmates running the asylum) to Petersen (strict disciplinarian) basically overnight.

Peters is a passionate player that didn't know how to channel frustration in a new scenario, and handled it poorly. In a situation like KC, with Andy Reid (known for working well with hotheads) and a strong veteran locker room of guys that have been on great teams and shitty ones (Alex Smith and Derrick Johnson spring to mind immediately), he should be in a good situation to grow into a professional."
"2015-05-14 15:21:28","NFL_Draft","enfyte416",3,"From what I've watched I've seen him get driven back quite a bit because he is just way too tall to get his pad level low. I think you are right that he has trouble staying in front of speed rushers. 

Just some other things I've seen, he seems like a low effort player. He doesn't finish plays and I've seen multiple times where he would just be standing around while Barrett or Cardale are still running for their lives. Decker is also a catcher. He has strong hands but he doesn't really use it since he absorbs contact instead of initiating contact. It makes him even easier to drive backwards. 

I see a bunch of traits that you want in a good offensive lineman but I don't think Decker has put that all together. "
"2015-05-14 15:22:33","NFL_Draft","dfo90",1,"How do next year's RB prospects compare to the 2015 class?

Do guys like Derrick Henry (ALA) and Ezekiel Elliot (OSU) have 1st Round potential like Gurley and Gordon?"
"2015-05-14 15:27:57","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"I think part of his pad level issue is his base. He needs to get wider to set himself better, as he clearly has the strength to anchor well. I agree he needs to punch better in pass protection but I think he does a good job in the run game, though he should work on extending more. But the speed rusher thing is the big issue, he is likely a right tackle at the next level."
"2015-05-14 15:51:11","NFL_Draft","steve_millers_joker",2,"It's also worth noting that Mo Wilkerson is in the last year of his deal and he is going to get mega-paid. There's always a chance that you can't outbid your competition and it's good to have an insurance policy. Being able to transfer from Wilk and Sheldon to Leonard and Sheldon will cushion the blow. "
"2015-05-14 16:16:46","NFL_Draft","ltownsoccer11",3,"Personally, I would rank Elliot between Gurley and Gordon with Henry being a mid-late 2nd if they all came out together.

"2015-05-14 19:44:26","NFL_Draft","atheist4thecause",0,"I don't see Henry as a Top 2 RB in the 2016 NFL Draft. When I compare Henry to other Alabama RB's like Trent Richardson and Eddie Lacy, Henry looks worse to me.

I am just starting watching these next year's guys, but from what I've seen out of the RB's already, I think the 2016 NFL Draft class will be better. That's a pretty bold statement given that there were a pair of 1st Round RB's and a slew of guys after that. 8 RB's went in the first two days. But when I look at guys like Corey Clement WISCONSIN, Ezekiel Elliot OHIO ST, Derrick Henry ALABAMA (even though I don't see him as a Top 2 RB, he shouldn't be ignored because he's in the conversation), and yet you still have others to fill in that high depth in guys like Alex Collins ARKANSAS.

Corey Clement is my guy, though. He has power, elusiveness, and he can catch the ball even though he doesn't do it much. He's not a burner but he has enough speed to take it to the house. The way I see it is that Clement is better than Gordon and Gordon went mid-1st. There styles are different, but I think Clement's style translates much better to the NFL where he can get those tough inside yards, shake people off, and deliver a very good stiff arm to keep people off of him. He breaks arm tackles with no problem and doesn't even lose much speed. I also think he has very good vision. Because of his physicality, he should have no problem protecting the passer once he learns all of the responsibilities. Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByOvUnWh6X4) that really shows what Clement can do.

I know fans constantly say the new starter is going to be better (ie Chubb is better than Gurley which I don't see at all), but in this case I think there is a very good basis for it. Gordon was a 3-star recruit out of high school while Clement was a 4-star recruit. Clement has better size for the position, better hands, better power, and yet he's not slower than Gordon. I'm so hyped to see Clement play this year."
"2015-05-14 19:52:13","NFL_Draft","enfyte416",2,"Agreed, many guys who are being hyped up as first rounders are definitely not on the level of even the second or third best 2014-2015 guys right now, but they have a year to develop and prove otherwise. "
"2015-05-14 20:04:17","NFL_Draft","pestrich",4,"Joe Montana also has a .52 Completion rate. Brett Favre had a .524. Bob Griese had a .571. So you can be successful with a low %"
"2015-05-14 20:07:42","NFL_Draft","atheist4thecause",0,"Before the 2015 NFL Draft happened, I voiced some motor concerns about Brown. There is no way to really know why he fell, but I think that was a reason. He also didn't have the type of strength that teams look for at the position, and while strength is something that tends to improve consistently in the NFL, it just adds another concern. Teams may have seen him more as a 4-3 DT which is less valuable than a 3-4 NT as well.

For Alvin Dupree, he was being projected based on athleticism. There were some question marks on tape. His body is also a bigger body type, which would tend to make him more of a less valuable strong-side guy. I think some people saw him as a weakside pass-rusher because of his athleticism, though, so those that did put him higher. He also apparently scored a 13 on the Wonderlic. He went 22, which is about where he should have gone. Going higher would have been ignoring the concerns and going lower would have been ignoring the potential.

About the Jets, I think they probably just felt that Williams was by far the best player on the board and that they will make it work. Williams was a dark horse to go #1 for a while and up until the Draft it was thought that he would be gone by #4, so getting him at #6 was pretty nice for them.

About Marcus Peters, I think he'll move on from his character concerns. His coaches ended up backing him, and it seemed like a weird situation where his passion got the best of him, and watching interviews, he said the right things. I'm sure he was coached up on what to say, but I think it was genuine and he actually did learn a lesson. We will see, though."

"2015-05-14 20:20:28","NFL_Draft","_b_e_n_",1,"&gt; Why was their such disparity on how good of a prospect Bud Dupree is?

Basically just cause he's raw as hell. Some people see a mediocre football player, others see a superstar in the making.

&gt; What happened with Malcolm Brown that he fell to 32? 

No idea. I wonder if it has something to do with his motor. Got caught taking plays off last year, and he really struggled handling double teams.

&gt;  Is it strange that the jets, who gave an amazing d line before the draft, drafted Williams with the first rounder?

Yes

&gt; Lastly, do you think Marcus Peters character concerns will follow him into the NFL?

No clue, but I wouldn't worry to much. He's never been in a lot of trouble, he's just a bit of a hot head."

I've been a bit more casual with my scouting and probably will continue to be casually scouting as long as my work is understaffed, but I got a chance to watch Arizona/Boise State today and Florida State/Notre Dame earlier this week. I'm trying to transition from senior-heavy teams to teams with top prospects for next year.

I really like what I saw out of Scooby Wright and am not surprised at all that he is the top MLB so far. I was surprisingly impressed by the WRs this game; there were more drops than I'd like, but also an absurd amount of offensive snaps and they all were playing hard throughout the fourth. I also liked the Mario Edwards vs Ronnie Staley matchup in the ND game, watching Jalen Ramsey do work as usual, and that one tall receiver from ND stuck out to me. I'd definitely recommend either of these games if you missed them in your 2014 scouting before."

As mentioned, we take a lot of deep shots out of play action and rollouts which are fairly low percentage plays anyway. Our WR corps is also not the safest in terms of hands, although they were a lot better in 2014 vs. 2013. 

Cook needs to improve one thing to really ease concerns about his accuracy - improve his footwork. He shows the capability to make incredibly accurate throws, he just needs to improve consistency.

 It's actually kind of funny considering his completion % went down in 2014, but he was far more accurate overall - we just took way more deep shots which drags that down. "

I think Williams is as fast, has better hands, and is a better all around receiver, so I can see him as the second best in the class right now. If he improves his routes and puts up great numbers this year, he can maybe make it around #10-to-15overall-range

"2015-05-16 01:38:06","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",3,"You don't need to be able to juke people out of their shoes. Elliot plain and simple does not go down.

"2015-05-16 01:52:43","NFL_Draft","atheist4thecause",0,"Gordon absolutely is not faster. Gordon consistently got caught from behind. Sure, he made a lot of huge runs, but he left a lot of yards on the field by getting caught from behind. Also, you have to remember that Gurley played through a lot of injuries so some tape may have him playing slower than he is. That tape you linked shows Gurley absolutely pulling away from that CB until he starts jogging at the 20. Re-watch it and specifically watch for when Gurley hits around the 30 yard line. I think you'll see the 4.4 speed there. Look at the end of this run: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF7lFOVUoAM

None of those little guys are catching Gurley. I understand it's KR and not a run, but I think that shows the speed. He did the same thing against Clemson. I understand this video, kind of sucks, but look at how Gordon gets caught against LSU (and this was typical): https://youtu.be/HsnQkFKz2t4?t=19s

That kind of stuff didn't happen to Gurley nearly as much. As much as I love Gordon as a Badgers fan, I give respect where it's due and Gurley was just the better, faster, more physical player."

"2015-05-16 01:57:03","NFL_Draft","atheist4thecause",3,"The thing about the bowling ball argument is that it's really hard to make it in the NFL if you can't make guys miss. Guys hit harder in the NFL so you have to be able to set them up with the threat of a cut or something like that. What's going to happen if defenders don't fear his ability to make people miss is he's going to get squared up, absolutely rocked, and be constantly injured. I agree with you on the bowling ball aspect, but I think to call Elliott a Top 15 prospect based on that bowling ball trait that is highly overvaluing it. He needs more than just that to be a Top 15 pick. Obviously, you mentioned the 4.4 speed but is there anything else he has like a good stiff arm or something? I think what you are explaining explains a 2nd rounder perfectly. What makes Elliott better than some of these 2nd-3rd rounders like Duke Johnson, TJ Yeldon, etc. from this last year?"

4. Jaylon Smith and Myles Jack are elite prospects.

6. Fuller is better than Vernon. "

Williams was a guy who *looked* like a top prospect and flashed occasionally enough to make scouts cream their pants thinking about the projection, but the thing that most missed was two very key weaknesses. 1. He was very slow off the ball and tended to stand straight up 2. Lack of explosiveness impacted his pass rushing and run defense ALOT. When he won, it was just brute strength.

I don't know where this idea that he sucks comes from. His accuracy is very inconsistent, but hopefully he can improve his footwork. His poise, pocket presence, athleticism, ability to maneuver in the pocket keeping his eyes downfield, and arm talent are all exceptional. When he is on he is almost on a Luck level, the problem is that he is off quite a bit.

I think Nkemdiche is much more explosive an athlete that Williams and I also think he will be an edge guy at the next level instead of interior line. 

I agree on Jack but not Smith. Unlike Jack, Smith doesn't play stronger than his size and his instincts look average at best to me. 

I think Stanley and especially Tunsil are better than them too. You could make the case for Robinson over Stanley, but a tackle with the foot speed of Tunsil doesn't come along often. He is an elite left tackle prospect. Robinson has tons of upside but he will never be that great of a pass protector, and I think Scherff is a guard prospect.

This I heavily disagree with. Fuller is a good corner but i think he needs to work on his balance and getting his head around for the ball. Hargreaves is an elite talent with no actual weakness that I can find, he even tackles very well. He's the best corner I've scouted and a better prospect that Patrick Peterson was coming out."
"2015-05-16 17:00:28","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",9,"He really isn't. His accuracy is very inconsistent, but when he is on he looks like Andrew Luck there. This year is important for him, he must makes big strides with his footwork."

"2015-05-16 17:03:36","NFL_Draft","noshcast",3,"Not sure why you think Goff doesn't have as much ""upside"" as Hackenberg or Cook."
"2015-05-16 17:05:29","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"Average arm and less mobility. Goff is a polished prospect, but I don't think he has the arm throw lasers between defenders like Aaron Rodgers does. I think Cook and Hack both have that arm talent."
"2015-05-16 17:17:56","NFL_Draft","thekyle1591",1,"Bosa is a freak. But what makes him so special is not only is he a freak, but he is as technically refined a prospect there is. Clowney was the most dominant prospect I've ever watched, but Bosa has the potential to be as good or better with another season under his belt. Robert didn't impress me at all tbh. Got no pressure and wasn't dominant against the run like I had expected. Not a huge fan. Doesn't flash his elite athleticism enough. 

2013 Hackenburg, aka the good Hackenburg, was Luck like in the fact that it seemed almost every pass attempt was a play action one. He was good for the most part, but I didn't see top 5 for the simple fact that he fucked up far too much and was horrendously bad at throwing the deep ball. The 2014 tape was just horrendous. The game vs OSU was as poor a game as I had seen from a qb all year. Hack is a guy who looks and should play like Luck, but simply doesn't. 

The left tackle call is gonna be amazing next year. Tunsil, Stanley, the kid from Michigan St and the Alabama kid if he's old enough, don't think he is. I've never seen run blockers as dominant as Robinson or Schereff, and Brandon's 2013 season was as good as I've seen from a college tackle. 

I've seen almost every snap of Fullers career, and I can honestly say I've seen him beaten badly less than 10 times. Doesn't fuck up ever. No mental mistakes, no poor technique, nothing. VG3 is a very very good prospect but he was absolutely embarrassed by Cooper. VG3 is the superior athlete and definitely flashier but Ive never seen a corner at tech as good as Kendall, including Kyle and the other various draft picks from the tech DB factory. "
"2015-05-16 17:23:49","NFL_Draft","EonKayoh",-4,"That's just silly.  He's not a better prospect than Eddy Lacy imo, just faster."
"2015-05-16 17:28:01","NFL_Draft","Coys11",1,"As of right now I don't think DE would be our biggest need for next season. I'm not saying Oakman is or isn't worth it as I haven't started scouting yet, I just think that other positions could be addressed "
"2015-05-16 17:29:31","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"I think Bosa is an excellent prospect but I wouldn't define him as a freak. He's very strong, has good athleticism, and great technique, but he isn't exceptionally quick off the ball, though still pretty fast. Nkemdiche just explodes off the ball. He does need technique work and I do have Bosa rated higher, but I still view him as an excellent prospect.

I do agree with you that when he is bad he is really bad. But the good is just so insanely good. He's someone I will keep a close eye on.

Cooper did not embarrass Hargreaves, that is just the stat line talking. Cooper moved all over the field and Hargreaves wasn't even on him half the time. When matched up one on one Cooper had 5 catches for 51 yards and a touchdown, far from an embarrassment. He has incredibly fluid hips, excellent recovery speed, very good technique, and is a physical and aggressive tackler. Fuller doesn't get beaten badly but he still gets beat occasionally. Just on the Ohio State game alone there were several plays where he had a hard time keeping his balance. I know that was a bad game for him but I still don't see an elite talent."
"2015-05-16 17:32:45","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",4,"I don't see how it's silly. Lacy doesn't have the balance, vision, or cutback ability Gurley does. I may be wrong on how great I think he will be but other teams clearly see the same thing. You have to be an elite talent to be taken top 10 as a running back, especially with the ACL tear."
"2015-05-16 17:33:30","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"I thought about offensive line, but besides Poe you don't really have any impact players alone the defensive line. Oakman's potential plays a part too, he may just be too hard to pass on there."

Hackenburg has always been medicore to bad in the 6 or so games I've seen. Is there any specific game that jumps out as one in which he dominated?

Cooper did embarrass VG3. Almost every time he actually matched up on Cooper he was beaten. The only time he wasn't was when Cooper was called for a push off that would've been a TD. He also missed like 2-3 tackles. "

I don't think he's really bad in pass protection, it's just not his strong suit. He will never be a great pass protector, but I think he will be solid as well as a big powerful mauler in the run game. I think putting him on the right side and moving Fusco to the left would be an interesting idea. AP running behind him and Loadholt would be dangerous."
"2015-05-16 17:59:10","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"Where else would you go there? The only other prospect I was really considering was Conklin. I just thought adding Oakman to that line could give you a very scary front."

"2015-05-16 18:02:45","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"His route running is just atrocious and he showed very little effort in blocking and plays when he wasn't a primary target. I just don't see a first rounder."

"2015-05-16 18:05:29","NFL_Draft","thekyle1591",1,"Even when they didn't throw it to Cooper or he was penalized he still beat him. That one game doesn't make VG3 a non-elite prospect at all, I just personally think Fuller is better."

"2015-05-16 19:14:13","NFL_Draft","EonKayoh",1,"I mean, fwiw, I'm not trying to say Gurley isn't good.  I know full well that he's very good &amp; will be an excellent addition for St. Louis.  I'm just saying that it's silly to call him generational.  There are two generational RBs that've been taken in the last decade: Peterson and Lynch.  One of those guys was a bust for the team that drafted him.  I don't think Gurley is on the same level as either of them.  I rank him more with Bell/Lacy/Hyde/Hill than Lynch/Peterson."
"2015-05-16 19:17:59","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"I think he is on Peterson's level and better than Lynch honestly. We will have to wait and see."
"2015-05-16 19:18:44","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"He's a 3rd rounder to me, I just don't think he has the arm to threat the needle in the NFL."
"2015-05-16 19:24:20","NFL_Draft","EonKayoh",1,"That's why I think it's silly.  Peterson had all of Gurley's power and speed, but about a billion times more elusiveness and wiggle.  Lynch had plays where he just refused to go down, the so-called ""beast mode"" runs.  Gurley though?  I think he's got great power with a head of steam, but he isn't shifty in the open field at all and he goes down too easily if he can't build up momentum.  I compare Gurley more to Michael Turner in his prime than Lynch and Peterson."
"2015-05-16 19:35:13","NFL_Draft","dseals",1,"I really don't think the Texans will take a first round running back. Since Rick Smith has been the GM the earliest the team has taken a RB was the 2nd round and we took Tate. Steve Slaton is the only other day 2 running back we've taken and Blue and Hilliard are both late round picks. I think thanks to Foster's success as a UDFA Smith is more likely to lean on finding a franchise running back outside of the first round and instead focus on other needs."

In the 2nd one I think he missed a few holes, but overall, still pretty good. He also saved a couple of fumbles because Stave was giving him the ball way too high. This is him as a Freshman and he's gotten a lot better making guys miss and having the strength to not just barrel into these guys but to bounce off and keep running. I think Clement is pro-ready, he just needs to showcase his talents this year."

If he isn't a MLB, I think we'd probably take Ramsey or the best available OT (if Joeckel doesn't pick it up this year).

Good mock, though. Really appreciate you doing all the scouting reports and stuff, it'll be fun to watch how a lot of these players progress in their final year at college."
"2015-05-16 20:09:00","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"His best position is probably weak side linebacker. He could probably play inside, but you are better off pairing him with a thumper inside. His real strength is coverage. He keeps up with slot receivers and is all over them.

"2015-05-16 20:22:13","NFL_Draft","dseals",2,"Really don't think we'll go EDGE because it looks like Mercilus is making the switch over to SAM and there's no way we give up on Clowney yet. I'd say right now our biggest needs would be safety (and this looks like a great year to need one), DE, NT, and RB. Crick is in a contract year and needs to show some major improvement for us to keep him over drafting a guy like Adolphus Washington."
"2015-05-16 20:25:05","NFL_Draft","dseals",1,"I really liked his play too. He's got some nice speed and ideal size at 5'11 210.

Jack is clearly better, but it seems wasteful. "
"2015-05-16 21:11:46","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"I guess it depends. I know you guys use the Seattle style defense so you need linebackers who can cover a lot of ground underneath.

Ellis is on a 1 year deal so he may be gone in 2016. Cullen Jenkins will almost certainly be gone, leaving Johnathan Hankins and the unproven Jay Bromley as the only players left at the position. Right now DT &gt;&gt; DE as far as needs go, and I think another big man in the middle would be welcome here. There were those who wanted us to draft Danny Shelton, after all."

"2015-05-18 00:12:20","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",9,"The most logical answer is accuracy, but that can be improved through better mechanics a lot of times. To me there is one defining trait that separates a franchise quarterback from the pack and that is poise under pressure. You can improve your accuracy, get better at making reads, manage average arm strength, but if you are scared of the defenders coming at you then you are never going to be a star quarterback."

"2015-05-18 00:15:57","NFL_Draft","Rhino184",5,"Gronk at 7 and Dez at 8 are massive steals. I'd take either over D Thomas "
"2015-05-18 00:18:42","NFL_Draft","darkforce547",3,"Well, let's break accuracy down. While we all would admit it's important, which accuracy is most important?

* Short accuracy with passes to the flats and on screens?
* Intermediate accuracy in 10-20 yard range?
* Deep accuracy and ability to make the big play?
* Any other types of accuracy?

What would you say are the important traits that show poise in the pocket?

* Stepping up into pressure?
* Throwing in the face of taking a hit?
* Other skills?"
"2015-05-18 00:25:46","NFL_Draft","facetiously",4,"Leadership skills.  The ability to take control of the huddle, the lockerroom and to instill loyalty and trust throughout the team.  To be a mentor and to be the hammer.  All great QBs have/had this.

This is why Jay Cutler will never be great."
"2015-05-18 00:35:54","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",4,"In my opinion intermediate accuracy is the most important. Even if you don't have great short accuracy you still can hit your man right more often than not. Also, if you just take short plays over and over you are bound to have mistakes that kill the drive. Deep accuracy is flashy but there are limited opportunities to just throw it up and you need time in the pocket. Intermediate accuracy is the most important because that is where the majority of defenders are so you need to be more precise, and it's how you will pick up the majority of your third downs. 

Stepping up into pressure, delivering the ball when you know you will be hit, and keeping your eyes downfield and not looking at rushers. Also a plus if you can maneuver and avoid pressure inside the pocket, especially if you aren't a great athlete that can run.

"
"2015-05-18 00:38:53","NFL_Draft","enfyte416",5,"Not that this is one of the most important things, but remember that arm strength is not just how far you throw the ball. Kellen Moore could get the ball 55-60 yards down the field but he needed to take a huge wind up and put a bunch of air under it. You see guys with real arm strength zip the ball with a flick of their wrist. Look at velocity when you are looking for arm strength, not distance. "
"2015-05-18 00:42:37","NFL_Draft","darkforce547",1,"This is definitely a great point. There are plenty of QBs that have the skills but can't get the team to follow them."
"2015-05-18 00:43:53","NFL_Draft","darkforce547",3,"This is definitely a huge thing. A lot of people ignore velocity as an important factor. Those small windows are only open for so long, so you have to be able to get it in there when it's actually open."
"2015-05-18 00:46:39","NFL_Draft","darkforce547",2,"Great job breaking these down! 

For those that don't know what Dorago's talking about in terms of avoiding pressure inside the pocket, think Tom Brady and how he's in no way fast but he makes subtle shifts to alter pressure."
"2015-05-18 00:52:54","NFL_Draft","_b_e_n_",9,"Sorry fellas, got the cancelled memo but missed the uncancelled memo. 

I'm happy with the Bosa pick, that would probably have been my second choice. I would have gone with Tunsil."
"2015-05-18 00:54:26","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",2,"Exactly who I was thinking of. Brady isn't a great athlete but he manages to slip around in the pocket just enough to make defenders miss. Hackenberg does it too, it's one of my favorite traits of his."
"2015-05-18 00:56:45","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"There were only a couple guys there tonight so it went pretty fast and your pick was likely not by a fan of your team. I did every third team (3,6,9,etc) so if there are any questions fire away."
"2015-05-18 00:57:45","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",2,"Tunsil was the steal of the draft. Even with a broken leg, he is a true elite left tackle prospect with his feet."
"2015-05-18 01:02:42","NFL_Draft","_b_e_n_",3,"One of the biggest things I look for is the relationship between performance and technique.

So few QB's are NFL ready right out of college guys are bound to have some issues to their games.

If a player has incredible assets (I.E) Brandon Bridge (perfect size, great athlete, monster arm) then I try and see when he performs at his best. The reason I was so high on Bridge was because I could see that he was an accurate passer when his technique was solid. If he is accurate when his footwork is proper, he gets set, and follows through, then all he needs is some coaching to ensure he does that all the time, while being pressured etc etc.

If however, a player, (I.E) Jake Locker, gets set, and throws with proper technique and still misses has target by a few feet, then I start to get worried. 

We've pretty much seen over the last number of years that accuracy issues can't be fixed, but technique CAN be fixed. 

Jake Locker = inaccurate arm.

Christian Hackenberg = inconsistent form

One is cureable. One isn't."
"2015-05-18 01:06:58","NFL_Draft","_b_e_n_",1,"Yeah if the leg turns out to be a non-issue when he plays this year then he might just be my #1 player. I have a higher early grade on him than Bosa, Stanley, Nkemdiche, Hargreaves and Treadwell."
"2015-05-18 01:17:46","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"I like him a lot but his lack of power in the run game keeps him down to 3. He's good technique wise but he never really drives his man far. I don't think he ever be a dominant run blocker, whereas Bosa and Hargreaves are great in every aspect of their game. If he really improves that this year he may move up to 2, but I still think Hargreaves is the most complete player in college football so unless he really falls off he will stay my number one."
"2015-05-18 01:35:34","NFL_Draft","darkforce547",3,"I think that's a great point. We need to determine just what skills a player can reasonably be expected to develop and improve upon. I think, in some sense, that's definitely something transferable to all positions. "

"2015-05-18 01:48:59","NFL_Draft","_b_e_n_",2,"And ability to change velocity. Some guys (Bridge works as an example again) can only throw bullets, can't put some air under a pass. "
"2015-05-18 01:54:15","NFL_Draft","darkforce547",2,"Definitely. A good QB definitely has to differentiate between whether he needs to use a bullet or touch pass."

3. We don't know the intricacies of the offense or what the coordinators/headcoach was are telling the QB in regards to the next play



4. We don't know who he is really looking at/who he is looking off. 



All in all we can look at the outcome of a play/how accurate a QB is but other than that we are guessing. That is why I have rarely(once) tried to predict a QBs future.

I don't expect them to have a winning record for a few years. As of right now, they have more holes than a block of swiss cheese and QB is not the problem."

"2015-05-18 04:55:35","NFL_Draft","dseals",4,"1. Yeah we do most of the time. You can look at the routes and figure out what the play is through replays or even on the broadcast angles.

2. We don't, but we can see how effective or ineffective they are and that is key, i.e. a QB calls out the line protections and still gets pressured quickly would be a sign of an incorrect read.

3. Not in great detail, but we can certainly identify the type of offense based on how often the QB goes under center, how quickly their reads are made, their progressions through reads, etc. The second part not even scouts know, but it sure as hell doesn't stop them so it shouldn't stop us.

4. Oh hell yes we do. You can follow the QB's eyes via his head movement. If the QB drops back and looks directly at the safety and then turns and fires then he's clearly freezing the safeties and throwing with anticipation to a route he expects to be open. If the QB is following his first read for a bit and then suddenly turns and throws to another receiver then he was pretty clearly attempting to look off the safeties and draw them one way before going another. That part is probably the easiest thing you listed for us to figure out."

Except that you know the connection is so much stronger than that, and taking out important aspects and  reducing it to being that simple just makes you look irrational. Hackenberg is THE prototypical O'Brien QB, and is one that had immense success under O'Brien's tutelage.

Let's not get crazy now. I wouldn't call 2955 yards with a 58.9% completion rate, and a 20-10 TD to INT ratio ""immense success."" He had a good year for a freshman, so what?

Mallett is the prototypical O'Brien QB too and so is Savage. All O'Brien wants in a QB is a good arm, accuracy, intelligence, and leadership. Newsflash, that's literally every coach's prototypical QB. O'Brien prefers bigger QBs and that's something most people have noted, but the fact that he coached Hackenberg for one season doesn't mean he's going to abandon Mallett and Savage for Hackenberg. O'Brien just wants the QB that will get the job done. If he thinks it's Hackenberg then that's a different story, but just because he recruited and coached Hackenberg doesn't mean he wants him on his NFL team.

If we're talking system match Mallett was a Patriot for 3 years and O'Brien runs a system nearly identical to that. Why would Mallett not be the ideal QB then? He checks all the boxes up above just as well as Hackenberg does and he has experience. The only reason people match O'Brien to Hackenberg is because of the Penn State connection and if anything O'Brien showed that the PSU connection doesn't not affect what types of players he wants."

Once you did, I simply pointed out that Mallett and Savage both fit his system just as well so why would he *need* to go after Hack then as OP stated?

You haven't exactly proven anything against my point either. Hackenberg is pretty widely regarded as a great prototype QB for *any* team. The only obvious connection between O'Brien and Hackenberg is Penn State and O'Brien hasn't gone after any Penn State players that he coached so the whole PSU connection is overblown. OB's system isn't vastly different to the ones run by other head coaches so I don't see why this is a Mariota/Kelly situation because he isn't running anything radically new here."

It is probably more relevant for their 2016 class than any other tape because it shows how much better their offense looks with their new starter at QB, Zaire.

My goal is to raise awareness about an issue, which can create change. Also, the point I'm getting at is basically that he creating a bias within himself because he has taken some things, attached emotional language to them, and exaggerated the issues (such as saying the routes Tyler Boyd runs are at a high school level).

Yes, I am a very blunt person. I don't think my comments will cause anybody to leave, either, and honestly, I don't think we should be walking on egg shells in fear that someone might leave."

"2015-05-19 00:35:14","NFL_Draft","atheist4thecause",1,"I think I am being fair by posting what is actually being said about his work ethic by the people who know him best. Sure, his coach probably wouldn't throw him under the bus (although that has happened before), but I doubt the coach would go out of his way to say how proud he is of Boyd for the work he put in if he was actually a lazy person. Sure, this article was from November of 2013, and things could have changed, but this is pretty solid evidence that he's not lazy. His production is also circumstantial evidence. There may be some things he needs to work on (like chasing down a ball carrier after an INT), but I think this gives necessary perspective."
"2015-05-19 00:37:59","NFL_Draft","enfyte416",1,"I actually haven't watched much of Tunsil yet, which is why I put subject to change. One thing I love about Stanley is his hand usage. Rarely ever loses the hands battle. "

&gt; Connor Halliday, on both a statistical and metaphysical level, endured one of the hardest and most viscerally unfair careers in recent college football history. He suffered grotesque injury in brutal conditions, played through inordinate amounts of pain, and took the field against teams like Oregon in zero-hope situations so many times it makes the career of Nick Foles at Arizona look like a happy story in comparison. No one threw more or more furiously in impossible games, and few came closer to winning without ever touching the high side of .500."

Feedback, both positive and negative, would be appreciated!"
"2015-05-20 22:38:17","NFL_Draft","backgrinder",1,"Spurrier was an awful QB coach. An amazing WR coach, his guys could run under lazy lob passes all over the field and turn them into TD's, but his QB's all sucked it up pretty bad.

 The feeling I always got from watching his offenses during the Florida glory years was that he had built the kind of offense he wishes he had had as a QB. Great lines, great backs, powerful running game, and dominant wides who could catch anything against anybody. Never a QB as good as he was though, and he was a little overrated himself."
"2015-05-20 22:47:13","NFL_Draft","backgrinder",1," It happens. I have always had a very good eye for QB play, enough that I (justifiably) take pride in my picks there. I usually pick the hits accurately, and the big 1st round misses as well. I have a couple of bad misses in there too though. I thought Ryan Tannehill would be a much better QB than Mathew Stafford, and while there's still a shot for it it's looking less likely. I also thought Stafford would never be anything better than mediocre and while he's no Peyton Manning he's solidly above average. 

 Probably my worst miss was David Carr. I honestly thought he was the real deal and a great pick for Houston. Now in my (and David Carr's) defense I never factored in Charlie Casserly thinking he could relive the 80's and never select an offensive lineman in the first 3 rounds and be ok only to see his QB murdered every Sunday. Who knows what Carr would have been with a real line in front of him? But he had the line he had and put up the numbers he put up, which wasn't much. Damn it, now you have me all worked up and questioning my QB selection magic!!

 Still, when you think about making a mistake like this when you have whole drafts to evaluate, and figure a GM will get a 5 year deal, only 7 picks a year and have probably one shot at getting it right at QB or they are fired it really shows you just how tiny their margin of error is. "

Bosa, Decker, Lee, Elliott, &lt;insert QB here&gt;, and more for OSU. 

One guy to keep an eye out for on MSU's DL is Lawrence Thomas, the DE opposite Calhoun. He came in as a LB, bulked up and played FB for a year. Then was a starting DT last year and was fairly good for the position. Now he's lost some weight and has plus athleticism for the DE position. A lot of us are expecting a big year from him - could definitely work his way into NFL consideration as a guy with good athleticism and excellent positional flexibility. "

"2015-05-21 07:03:06","NFL_Draft","PwnzillaGorilla",2,"He's one of my favorite QB prospects, a higher-floor Logan Thomas who can make all sorts of a throws and run when he needs to. Hoping he does well this season so we might take a chance on him in the latter part of the 1st or maybe 2nd."

"2015-05-21 13:07:33","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"Cornerback is a position that generally isn't a high priority at the top of the draft, so it's rare that more than one guy is taken in the top 10. Hargreaves is pretty much locked in as the first corner off the board, assuming he doesn't completely implode this year. I also think Ramsey has a better skill set as a safety with not the best top end speed but great ball skills and blitzing ability."

I don't think he's hopping around like that because he isn't comfortable, I think it's because he's always resetting and therefore always ready to make a throw when he sees it because his feet are already in place. I do agree that he needs to handle pressure better though, there is a notable drop off in accuracy and decision making."
"2015-05-21 16:14:41","NFL_Draft","sio-kedelic",2,"I will probably grow to like it, because like you said, I've seen similar tendencies from Peyton. I also see it a lot with Brady, and I feel like it might just be his way of keeping his QB rhythm and staying active. I just didn't like it getting in the way of him setting his feet on some throws.

I tried not to mark him down because of it specifically, but I still tend to pepper my notes with stuff like that so I can make a mention of it in my more cumulative scouting reports later."

"2015-05-21 18:02:04","NFL_Draft","jross7394",2,"I think the biggest problem with his feet is that he takes a lot of unnecessary steps when he's scrambling or moving out of the pocket. I kept thinking he was going to trip himself."

"2015-05-21 18:26:38","NFL_Draft","Alexander_Hamilton_",1,"I never trust coaches. They are completely biased by either praising a player a lot or throwing him under the bus if they are truly bad. I don't think this is evidence that Boyd is a hard worker, but a lot of Dorango's arguments about Boyd was based on his on the field effort which can be observed by an outside viewer. We don't know his off the field work ethic but his on the field ethic can be seen as lacking."
"2015-05-21 19:04:55","NFL_Draft","sio-kedelic",1,"I agree. Luckily, he is exceptional at throwing from really awkward platforms, like in [plus play five](http://www.draftbreakdown.com/gif-embed/?clip=259729&amp;gif=AngelicDazzlingBactrian), but I would just like him to show that he is able to be calm and collected."
"2015-05-21 20:02:07","NFL_Draft","jbaugues",1,"I am just curious what that says to scouts and if that will cause him to fall.

No way. He's a day 3 guy. He has to improve A LOT before he can even think about rounds 2 or 3, let alone a first rounder. "
"2015-05-21 21:15:03","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",5,"How is he a day three guy? Top notch arm talent, pretty good accuracy, goes through his reads well, and flashes good footwork. If he can get more consistent with the footwork and force less passes why not? He was a top recruit for a reason."

"2015-05-21 21:40:51","NFL_Draft","osubeavs721",-7,"Because the way he plays. He doesn't have it. I am not even a big Hundley guy, but if Hundley is a late round pick, Kiel has no shot of being a higher pick. Hundley is better in all aspects. Bryce Petty too. He was a 4th and he is way ahead of Kiel. Kiel at best is a day 3 project guy. He has tools to be good, but will need to be brought along. "
"2015-05-21 21:47:01","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",13,"You can't just say he doesn't have it, what part of his game is lacking so much? Kiel is much more accurate than Hundley or Petty, and better at going through his progressions as well."

"2015-05-21 23:04:00","NFL_Draft","jbaugues",2,"As a coach though, I would be concerned that this Kiel is not going to be a team player and always looking to ask for a trade to a team where he might get a better chance to start.

"2015-05-21 23:14:02","NFL_Draft","sio-kedelic",1,"The more I loop [that 4th-4 conversion,](http://www.draftbreakdown.com/gif-embed/?clip=259729&amp;gif=VastHospitableGhostshrimp) the more I'm tempted to call that a plus play. Wow. Despite the game being fairly out of hand at this point, he still steps up from outside pressure and absolutely *drills* that ball in for a fourth-down conversion. That ball has some decent velocity even in slowmo lol

Do you guys think this should qualify as a plus play?"
"2015-05-21 23:33:23","NFL_Draft","TankVet",2,"Yeah, it's a possibility. I honestly don't know if the college thing smartened him up enough to know that the NFL is going to be vastly different. I just don't know enough either way. He's also got a very involved family. On the one hand it's ""strong support system,"" on the other it's ""helicopter parents."" 

Truth be told, his slow-ish release gives me more pause than anything. That's not quick enough for the NFL just yet."

"2015-05-22 00:05:29","NFL_Draft","tmagnus",4,"He is kind of the victim of helicopter parents. Apparently, his parents were insisting that he be a day one starter as a true freshman, and they kept yanking him from schools whose coaches wouldn't abide their demands."

"2015-05-22 02:06:40","NFL_Draft","backgrinder",1,"Alexander is a Right Tackle at LSU, not a guard. Depending on how well he can pass protect on the right side this year he may play the same position in the pros. If not he could flip inside and be a very good guard imo. "
"2015-05-22 02:31:38","NFL_Draft","Dorago1991",1,"He played left guard in the couple games I watched of him, and that's where he will play in the pros. Does not have the feet to be a tackle."
"2015-05-22 06:16:37","NFL_Draft","backgrinder",2,"&gt; Does not have the feet to be a tackle.

 I wouldn't state that as an absolute just yet. I'm an LSU fan and I've seen every snaps this guy has played in his career and a lot of him outside of game situations as well. The increases he's made in athleticism are pretty remarkable. He also has the best strength and conditioning program in the country preparing him for the next level.

 He has the strength speed combo to put guys on their back in the running game and do it on the first and second level. Against SEC defenders that requires pretty remarkable athleticism. He has bounced back and forth between guard and tackle and his footwork is unpolished as a result, but he came back to LSU for the chance to start at RT for a full year and try to get drafted there and make more money as a pro.

 I don't know if he will make it as an NFL RT, he's more likely a guard, and probably an extremely good one. I don't completely disagree with your statement in other words, just think it's more 60/40 when you are making a flat assertion here. He doesn't need that much pass blocking improvement to stick at tackle, at least not when you factor in the growth curve in athleticism he has already proven. I don't know if he will make it but he has a legit shot at it.

"2015-05-22 13:15:27","NFL_Draft","kickboxingpandas",2,"He doesn't seem to have great balance which is disconcerting. He could still be good but he goes down from diving tackles a lot"
"2015-05-22 13:15:49","NFL_Draft","sio-kedelic",1,"Hmm...well, it's tough to say. He has a really live arm and some exceptional accuracy when he has time, but I'm not a fan of how he handles pressure. The last guy I remember being like that is Blaine Gabbert, but I think Goff is improved in pretty much every way. Better arm, better accuracy, and at least can step up into a pocket every once in a while. Still probably worth noting that Gabbert was seen as a first-rounder predraft, and some mocks had the Panthers passing on Cam Newton for him (oh how silly hindsight looks sometimes lol).

The other post's comp to Bradford isn't bad either. Maybe blend Bradford and Gabbert?"
"2015-05-22 14:28:06","NFL_Draft","Typrestige98",1,"I like Booker a lot and he's like my 5th ranked RB right now in my preliminary rankings. "

I'm pretty sure that's what he came back to LSU for. Last year a lot of draft services were listing him as a 1st round guard prospect early in the process, so the switch to tackle was the reason to stay (and the chance to make more money in the NFL if he can pull this off).

I've been still transitioning into 2015 prospects, but this week was a bit lighter at work (aside from the day where I ended up staying 2 and a half hours later than I thought x_x), so I was able to watch a lot this week!

- Florida State vs Virginia (2014)- mainly just wanted to scout two new Raiders, Max Valles and Mario Edwards. Unsurprisingly, Ramsey is a beast. Winston sure threw some ugly ass picks in this game, though...

- Virginia vs VA Tech (2014) - this may be one of my favorite games from last year. Defensive slugfest turned shootout in the final minutes. I was again mainly watching for Valles, but I liked watching Kendall Fuller and the two Tech DE's. Virginia's receivers, especially Severins, actually impressed me a lot this game too.

- Virginia vs Duke - was looking forward to Cash vs Valles, but Cash got hurt early on and Valles was impactful but quiet most of the game. I like VAs receivers, even if they are a bit drop-prone. Smoke Mizell is pretty exciting. The Duke DBs are all pretty awesome, too."

The biggest thing I notice with him is that he's so good at winning the leverage battle. He's 6'4 but he plays really low and almost always gets under his man. He's pretty strong too, I don't see him get pushed off the ball often. He looks to have pretty good athleticism too."

"2015-05-25 02:16:23","NFL_Draft","OneManArmy77",2,"Decision making for me is most important, and I would say that the main sub trait is going to be the ability to work through reads

After that, I look at Accuracy as an indicator, with medium accuracy as the most important. Interestingly, we didnt include footwork in the  analysis, so I would factor that in here as why their throws are accurate/not accurate.

Those two are the most important traits in my opinion, so we get into the secondary grading area.

Next, pocket presence is most important, specifically pocket presence when facing the blitz/under pressure. Does he take his eyes away from downfield? Does he step up into the pocket? Does he know to tuck the ball? All important questions. I suppose footwork factors in here as well.

Leadership is next important for me, as I would also add off the field issues like Winston in here. This has the most to detract from a prospect since QBs are expected to be leaders.

another big divide into the tertiary skills. At this point, I look for a prospect to have these as a bonus generally, but if its integral to their game, I would bump it into the secondary area. The difference for that would be Cam Newton would have scrambling as a secondary attribute, whereas Mariota has it as a strong tertiary point.

Scrambling, as I mentioned earlier, is a big part here. If he can move the chains with his feet consistantly, thats a plus, but the main thing I look for is the ability to extend plays and occasionally pick up the first down, like Wilson, Luck, Rogers, Tannehill and Alex Smith.

Delivery and Armstrength go hand in hand for me. I look for touch on deep throws. Look at Peyton Manning for instance, even this late in his career, he throws ducks. Despite that, the ball is placed well and is catchable by his WRs. If hes got a rocket, thats great and can be bumped up into secondary traits like Favre or Stafford, but this tends to be pretty unimportant to me generally.

Let me also say that I grade based on comparing to the ideal QB for each trait as a sign of comparison, and I think we should be doing that as well. For instance, lets say Stafford is likely the quintessential example of having arm strength, and exemplifies what Im looking for in a normal QB in terms of that stat. As such, Ill set 7 to be an average rating in that stat, as in the average QB has about 70% as good arm strength as Stafford. Therefore, the QB im scouting will be judged to have a 9/10, or 90% of Stafford's arm strength. That makes it more easily comparable than saying ""hes a 8 for decision making as far as college QBs go"" and gives people an anchor to reference."
"2015-05-25 04:15:01","NFL_Draft","sio-kedelic",2,"I'll try doing this as a grading score out of 100 in order of importance. Feel free to debate the actual numbers with me, since this is just my opinion and weighted based on how I feel things should go.

**Accuracy: 35/100**

- *Intermediate Accuracy*: 15/100. This is weighted the heaviest to me as so many NFL passes take place at this depth. Can the QB hit curls, comebacks, and slants between 8-20 yards? Can he throw to both sides of the field well? (For scoring this, I'd give 2 points if the QB shows the ability to hit curls to his left, 2 more if he can hit the right deep slant, etc., for up to 12 points for each throw to each side) Is he leading his receivers by throwing them open (1 point)? Is he able to place the ball at different catch points for his receivers (1 point)? How good is he at timing his throws to his receivers' breaks (1 point)? 

- *Deep Ball Accuracy*: 10/100. How is the QB past 20 yards? 2 points for the QB if he can hit right, middle, and deep left shots (up to 6 pts), 3 points for throwing his receivers open, and 1 point for being able to change trajectories on deep shots (aka: not floating it on every ball).

- *Short Accuracy*: 10/100. Can the QB hit screens, slants, and wheel routes going left/right? (1 point for each throw to each side, 6 pts total) Can the QB change his ball's speed to accommodate the short game? (3 points) Can he lead his receivers open on screens or RBs on passes out of the backfield? (1 point)

**Pocket Presence: 20/100**

- *PP against standard pressure (&lt;5 rushers)*: 10/100. Does the QB step up into the pocket to avoid pressure from behind, and how smoothly do they move? (4 points) Does the QB sense pressure without having to drop his eyes? (4 points) Can the QB speed up his throwing motion when pressured and still keep his accuracy? (2 point)

- *PP against blitz:* 10/100. Everything from above, but in situations when there's 5 or more rushers. If a QB can't handle the blitz smoothly, they're not succeeding in the NFL.

**Leadership: 15/100**

- *On-field leadership:* 10/100. Does the QB's play stay the same or improve in the redzone? (5 points) How about during 2-minute drills? (2 points) Can he rally his team when they're down? (2 points) Does he regularly convert 3rd/4th downs? (1 points)

- *Off-field leadership:* 5/100. Does the QB encourage his teammates after their bad plays? (1 point) Is the QB a hard worker? (2 points) Does the QB compose himself well outside of game day? (2 points)

**Scrambling: 10/100**

- *Inside the Pocket:* 5/100. Can the QB slide his feet smoothly around the pocket (1 point)? Can he reset his feet for his throwing motion (1 point)? Does he run through his throwing lanes when necessary (1 point)? Can he do this while keeping his eyes downfield (1 point) and still be accurate (1 more point)?

- *Outside the Pocket:* 5/100. Can the QB roll out and throw, both without (1 point) and with (1 point) resetting his feet and to each side (for up to 4 points). Does the QB know when to appropriately bail from the pocket? (1 point)

**Decision-making: 10/100**

Can the QB make pre-snap adjustments (3 points)? Does the QB make good decisions and not throw into coverage (2 points)? Does he show the ability to get to his 2nd (1 point), 3rd (1 point), and 4th (1 point) reads in a play? Is the QB able to look off DBs (2 points)?

**Arm Strength/Velocity: 5/100**

Can the QB throw the ball with strong velocity (2 points)? Can the QB throw with a variety of velocities (2 points)? Does he throw with a tight spiral with minimal wobble (1 point)?

**Delivery: 5/100**

Is the QB setting his feet and turning into his throws to increase torque (2 points)? Is he throwing with a compact throwing motion (1 point)? Does he have a high release point (1 point)? Is he able to throw through throwing lanes (1 point)?"

"2015-05-25 06:37:12","NFL_Draft","saint52",3,"One note I found out in a conversation between two ex coaches (Steve Mariochi and Brian Billick on the coaches show podcast) that noted that it was not all that important for a QB to be accurate rolling out both ways as it can easily be removed from the playbook to suit the QB. It is a thing that is unavoidable in college due to the hash marks but it is easier in the Pros as the hashes are closer together."
"2015-05-25 06:38:58","NFL_Draft","saint52",1,"With the leadership stuff is all of it really necessary?
I mean red zone play yes. But when it comes to rallying a team? I just wonder if that is truly a trait of the QB and not a little arbitrary. I mean some teams just suck around the QB and a rally also depends on play calling. Also I feel the conversion of 3rd and 4th downs is a bit out of his hands. Not to say he doesn't factor in but it seems like a stat similar to yardage. Sure its a red flag but it is still out of his hands. Eg if the team can't run for shit they will be in more long 3rd downs. These are harder to complete than a 3rd and 1 on a PA boot pass than a 3rd and 20 where they need to drop back and wait for it to open up. 
My other thought is the hard worker and encouragement is a little bit of an opinion based thing. it can look like he is encouraging but is really chewing the guy out, or the TV crew may just not think it all that good of a shot. 

Also just a curiosity but Peyton Manning would be down at least 2 out of the 5 points for off field [shenanigans](http://thebiglead.com/2014/09/18/peyton-manning-1996-tennessee-lawsuit-trainer-bare-butt-mooning/)"

"2015-05-25 15:35:46","NFL_Draft","sio-kedelic",1,"Well, when I was assembling that list, I just thought about a lot of the top QB's in the past few drafts and what I've given positive/negative credit to in the past. Yes, the 3rd/4th down thing is slightly team-dependent, but if a QB is constantly putting passes where they need to be and his team is just failing to execute, you take note of that and give credit to the QB anyway. Obviously they aren't going to convert all the time, and converting a 3rd-20 is obviously much more impressive than converting a few 3rd-1's, but top QB's IMO should be better in those money situations. Not everyone is going to get credit for that, but not everyone *should* get credit for that. I feel like QB's who would get credit for this are those that really put the team on their back and are able to make those around them better, and that's actually a trait very few people have...but one that's important enough to give them a 5-point boost if they're exceptional it it.

The off-the-field stuff is a bit more subjective, I guess, but I still feel like it's important. QB's like Jameis Winston and Cam Newton had few on-the-field questions and both ended up going #1 overall, but their off-the-field stuff cast some serious question on their long-term appeal to a team. The criteria I listed might not be the best at representing that, but I feel like a 100/100 QB shouldn't have a single question about him, on-the-field or off, so I thought I kinda had to include it somewhere in my grading scale."
"2015-05-25 15:56:06","NFL_Draft","sio-kedelic",2,"I don't disagree with any of this, and we do obviously agree on similar traits.

I like your pocket presence list, alhtough I wish there was a way to divide it between standard pressure and blitz pressure, since I've noticed a fine line between QB's that look accurate in standard situations and QB's who thrive against the blitz. You sorta have it covered by grading how a QB does against internal/external pressure, which I didn't think of, but I just feel like we should somehow work ""accuracy against the blitz"" somewhere in there, since it seems fairly important to me.

Our accuracy thing is basically the same, too. I think you just rearranged some of the points to fit your other sections better. Yours is more condensed and probably easier to grade than mine. I kinda liked that mine had intermediate accuracy weighted more heavily than yours, but I'm not sure where I'd take away points from other sections to weigh this section more.

I'm not as sure about the decision-making section, though. A QB being on the same page as his receivers is as much on the receiver as it is on the QB, and I guess it's only one point, but I'm having a bit of a hard time seeing how you'd assign that point. Personally, I'd remove that criteria altogether and give another point to presnap reads, since I think that factors into decision-making more and sorta encompasses being on the same page with his guys anyway.

I almost totally agree on Delivery. The only thing I'd maybe add is a section on getting the ball to different catchpoints for the receiver, but you sorta already covered that in Accuracy with the Anticipation score.

How are you scoring intermediate velocity on a 5-point scale? I agree that it's necessary, but I'd probably take two points off of this and create a section on ""Delivering the Ball with different velocities."" Kaepernick is probably the most glaring QB I can think of that doesn't do this at all and it certainly affects his team's ability to move the ball at times. This would also give you 5 nice bullet points in evaluating arm strength. Again, I guess you have it covered in Accuracy with the Touch rating, but I just feel like it makes more sense as an Arm Strength thing than an Accuracy thing.

I'm alright with Scrambling since you covered in-the-pocket scrambling well in the Pocket Presence group. However, I'd probably put ""Knows when to hang in the pocket and when to scramble"" over your #5.

What's your leadership criteria? Is it similar to mine but just weighed differently? I guess it's a bit of an intangible thing to try and quantify, but I'm curious what you view as Leadership in a QB."

&gt; Accuracy moving to the left (&lt;11 yards) - 1 pt.

&gt; Accuracy moving left (11-20 yards) - 1 pt.
&gt; 
&gt; Accuracy moving to the right (&lt;10 yards) - 1 pt.
&gt; 
&gt; Accuracy moving right (11-20 yards) - 1 pt.

I think this is slightly overkill just cause you don't often see righty quarterbacks throwing while running left deep. I'd just combine them as Moving Right and Moving Left.

&gt; Compact release - 4 pts.
&gt; 

By this you mean like arm slot right? If yeah, then yup this is really important.

&gt; Touch - 2 pts. Can the quarterback put arc on the ball so that only the receiver can get it? Is he throwing things other than straight bullet passes?

Whhile I think this is pretty teachable, I think you could give it a few more points. Think some of the back shoulder throws Wilson made in the superbowl this year to that lanky guy no one had ever heard of. If that ball came with any more or less zip, it is picked or not caught. He put perfect touch on it so it dropped into the receivers hands.

Corners in college, even the best, sometimes have to use their athleticism to make up for mistakes (see: Waynes, Trae), but even the advanced athletes lose that advantage in the pros, so technique becomes even more of a priority. Plus, you have lots of receivers who are better than 90% of what you've faced in college at things like shaking off press coverage, route running, body control....

Also not for this year but Jake Butt from Michigan, again not a game breaker but reliable and a decent in line guy with 2 more years to develop before he is draftable"
"2015-05-28 08:48:04","NFL_Draft","saint52",4,"QBs
Jeff Driscol (ex-gator, forget where he relocated too): before I really started watching college there was a lot of hype for this guy, heard he came off a major injury last year, and didnt look too bad (not bottom of the barrel at least), so I wonder if he can dev into something

Jeremy Johnson (Auburn): Man watching the A day game there were some wow moments, hitting Duke on a post (or corner one of the 2) between 2 defenders, showed some touch and poise in the pocket, he wasn't live but still. Kinda a dark horse for me to end up #1 overall this year.

RBs
Not really fussed, the usual names
Clements, Elliot etc etc

WR
Rickey Seals Jones Texas A&amp;M: huge guy (thought he was a TE initially), but good catch radius, inconsistent last year (RS freshmen) decent athleticism and from memory is a basketball player out there, high pointing it and making the aggie QBs look good

Josh Reynolds Texas A&amp;M: he was solid for the aggies, providing the chain mover, from the 4 or 5 games of theirs I watched I cannot remember and miscommunication, just there, doing what he has to to help the team

Pharaoh Cooper SC gamecock: he is a great slot receiver as outlined by /u/Dorango1991 shows the RB playing out wide trait and was their wild cat QB

Laquon tread well Ole Miss: as outlined by the scouting reports

TE
may be
Vannett Ohio St: he was the TE I most liked at Ohio St, just felt he was a better football player than the guy they just lost to the broncos, Im hoping (key word here) that he can improve and make up some ground

DL
Deforest Buckner Oregon: he is what Armstead should get too this set of OTAs, hopefully, more of a cleaned up player with the same stupid dimensions

Adam Gotsis G Tech: bit small but a high motor guy and Australian. He will chase the running back 99 yards to stop a TD, I think he is more of a run stuffing end with some pass rush upside

EDGE
Eric Stricker OU: he was pegged by some as a smaller edge guy with 1st round potential, see how he irons out the kinks this year and we will see.

LB
Casanova McKinzey: name alone he is fun to watch for. But seriously a guy who can make plays at LB, but may fizzle out of relevance

Miles Jack UCLA: watch the Kansas St game, a few bone head plays but then there is that pick in the end zone against Lockette which he returns for a ridiculous amount of yards (nearly back to the LOS)

CB
Ishmael Adams UCLA: good returner, could improve on the back end but bears watching

The michigan CBs: some real talent there, but wether it amounts to anything is still up in the air

Zack Sanchez OU: from the games I watched he stoop out for a couple of reasons, great run defender, usually not beaten deep but when he was wow it always went for a TD (implying the coaches were comfortable with not providing him with any support) and he was always injured

I've noticed that he has small stretches of being drop-prone, so that will need to stop, but he is also capable of making some mindblowing catches and shows good size, speed, and catch radius to be a high pick next year.

- FS/CB: Jalen Ramsey (Florida State). I've already done a breakdown of him, but he grew into a fantastic versatile leader for the FSU defense. His backpedal and athleticism are just absurd.

- DT: Anthony Zettel (Penn State). If I had a sleeper pick for a high riser, it'll be him. Fantastic pass rushing DT with runstuffing skills and some insane power. I'm working on a breakdown for him :)

"2015-05-29 09:34:12","NFL_Draft","darkforce547",1,"Okay, I've been thinking on the points that you made. Especially trying to incorporate the blitz. Because while I included the ability to deal with the pressure, I don't know if I adequately accounted for accuracy and ability to make a play under pressure.

To kind of explain the being on the same page as receivers, I figure that it would be something like timing routes where the quarterback doesn't necessarily look as much as knows when the receiver is supposed to be where. We all know situations where the quarterback threw the wrong route or the receiver ran the wrong one.

For scoring intermediate velocity, I have it as an all or nothing 5 points. Either the quarterback throws with enough velocity that he gets the ball to the receiver without it causing much issue in terms of defenders being able to close on the ball or it just being a floater. So, small things like looking at the ball's spiral, watching how the defenders are able to react as opposed to the receiver who knows it's coming, etc.

As for the Kaepernick issue, I figure I covered that in a couple of different sections with the arm strength/velocity as well as the ability to throw with touch. Like you said, though, that might be an arm strength over accuracy thing. I put it under accuracy because it was more focused on getting the ball where it's supposed to be when it's supposed to be there as opposed to having the ability to get the ball there before the defenders. I'll have to think on how to break that down, though. I'm definitely willing to move things and have uneven categories. Potentially that would make Accuracy worth 18 points and Arm Strength worth 12.

I do like your ""knows when to hang in the pocket and when to scramble."" I'm not sure how to classify that or give a point value for it. My issue is that Brett Hundley is so recent and so many people feel that he scrambled too often in college when I felt he was staying in the pocket quite a bit. Knowing when to stay in the pocket is a bit fuzzy.

Leadership was essentially a general intangible. I don't expect every QB to be Matt Stafford putting the team on his back with a broken shoulder to throw the winning touchdown against Cleveland, but damn, if there was some way to know if all QBs could do that ha.

One thing that I wanted to include but I wasn't sure on (and actually considered cutting leadership all-together for this) was exchanges. Center to QB, QB to running back and QB to receiver on WR runs. They're an incredibly important part of the position, but I don't know how to score them. Suggestions?"
"2015-05-29 09:45:55","NFL_Draft","darkforce547",1,"&gt;&gt;Accuracy moving to the left (&lt;11 yards) - 1 pt.

&gt;&gt; moving left (11-20 yards) - 1 pt.

&gt;&gt;Accuracy moving to the right (&lt;10 yards) - 1 pt.

&gt;&gt;Accuracy moving right (11-20 yards) - 1 pt.

&gt;I think this is slightly overkill just cause you don't often see righty quarterbacks throwing while running left deep. I'd just combine them as Moving Right and Moving Left.

The reason that I set it up the way the I did was to get the players as many points as possible, even if it's for small things. As much as I can, I'd prefer the scores to be all or nothing because we're mostly looking at ""Well, can he do it or not?"" So, if he can throw running right intermediate (11-20) but only throw short (&lt;10) on the left, we can give him 3 points as opposed to only 2 because technically he can make throws on the right. Just not far downfield.

&gt;&gt;Compact release - 4 pts.

&gt;By this you mean like arm slot right? If yeah, then yup this is really important.

Exactly what I mean.

&gt;&gt;Touch - 2 pts. Can the quarterback put arc on the ball so that only the receiver can get it? Is he throwing things other than straight bullet passes?

&gt;Whhile I think this is pretty teachable, I think you could give it a few more points. Think some of the back shoulder throws Wilson made in the superbowl this year to that lanky guy no one had ever heard of. If that ball came with any more or less zip, it is picked or not caught. He put perfect touch on it so it dropped into the receivers hands.

I think you and /u/sio-kedelic bring up an interesting point here. I'm honestly not sure where the point value on this should be. I liked 2 points because while it's definitely helpful, it's not actually crucial. There are a number of quarterbacks in the league that lack touch like Kaepernick and Stafford yet are at least serviceable. So, if a QB can function without it, how highly should it be scored?

&gt;In theory this looks really good for the most part, I think we should put it to the test with two prospects we all agree are of slightly different calibers and see if it gives a reasonable grade. Say a Mariota vs Hundley or a Winston vs Petty. Nice work darkforce!!

First off, thanks! 

Second, I say we should avoid Hundley. He's one prospect that I think is harder to grade than people realize and would come a lot closer to Mariota than people would expect. I can see them being nearly identical by these metrics. That said, because it makes for a challenging comparison, it might just be the one that we need to do. Winston vs. Petty might give us a more distinct result of what we're expecting with a gap between their skill sets.

So, this brings us to an interesting challenge. How many games do we need to watch to properly score a player? And do we use the average between all the games? The high? The aggregate of all the skills shown?"
"2015-05-29 09:48:23","NFL_Draft","darkforce547",1,"I was definitely referencing your list quite a bit when making my score sheet, OMA. Obviously I had my own biases that led to different valuations, but I think you covered the basic skills rather well. What, may I ask, do you think of the point spreads that I used for my sheet?"
"2015-05-29 09:50:08","NFL_Draft","darkforce547",1,"At the same time, we've seen quarterbacks like Alex Smith and Peyton Manning excel without a strong deep ball at any point in their careers. So, the ability to throw deep should definitely be worth some points, but I'm not sure how absolutely vital it is, thus knocking it down a few."

Take for instance the quick release vs compact release bit you have. A compact release is valuable because it makes a quick release, effectively combining the two into one stat. Personally, Im not a fan of breaking down everything into numbers like that for each sub category either, but it looks fine overall. My problem is that it doesnt build in any room for major detracting factors. What happens if you have a QB that has giant red flags for leadership? Hes not gonna get those 5 points, but its not like thats going to show how much of a problem he actually is. Im of the opinion that a more flexible system is more useful when comparing so many factors."

Your team is in dire need of a running back who can punish you in short yardage and up the gut, but has soft hands and can catch and block like a motherfucker. It's the later half of the 2nd round of the 2016 Draft and you're on the clock with James Conner (Pitt) and Devon Johnson (Marshall) are the best two still on the board.

"2015-05-29 13:32:40","NFL_Draft","sio-kedelic",1,"Touch is weird to grade. I personally think it is super important and want to give it more points, since I think the QBs you listed are being held back by their lack of touch so far, but I'm struggling to see a way to actually do that.

- 0: shows no ability to take heat off of short passes (ex: Kaep)

- 1: shows ability to throw short passes with proper velocity sometimes, but isn't totally consistent at it and will sometimes lose control of his arm strength (ex: Derek Carr?)

- 2: shows full control of his arm, taking velocity off of his arms and always putting his receivers in the best position to make a play (ex: Aaron Rodgers)

I can't really see a way to squeeze even one more point into this grading scale, even though I think it is a relatively important skill compared to the other QB traits. I guess my 5-point scale in my OP was based on how important I felt it was, but now that I write down the scale, I can't really see how I would be able to score objectively on a scale bigger than 2 points."

he's got great size and speed and he uses that to consistently win the fight for the ball. Some critics claim he doesn't use his size (6'4"" 210 lbs) to his advantage enough, but he proves them wrong when the Tigers are in the red zone.

He hasn't put up big numbers the last two years. his freshman season, 2013, (20 Rec. 300 yards, 3 TD) was spent as a backup to Martavis Bryant and Sammy Watkins, and in 2014 (57 Rec. 1030 yards, 6 TD), he had Cole Stoudt, usually injured, throwing him the ball. He doesn't get targeted as much as other top end receivers because of WRU's insane receiver depth. I think with Deshaun Watson being healthy this year, we'll see Mike Williams take a leap forward in statistics just in time for him to make his case as one of the 2016 draft classes"
"2015-05-29 18:25:59","NFL_Draft","darkforce547",1,"I mean, part of it is that this is more like a ... skills inventory. Basically, does he have the skills or doesn't he? So, it's definitely going to have to be paired with a subjective element. This just gives a basis of ""hey, this is where this prospect is at."" Like, we're not taking into account how *well* the player does something until the scouting report. Having an inventory of skills, though, makes it easier to not ignore glaring deficiencies for other traits and keeps us from passing over things that a quarterback who may look bad actually does well. So, ideally, this would be combined with that more flexible system that you're looking for to give a more complete picture. The concept is more to get a full idea of what we're looking for and at least have a basis of similarity for scouting all prospects at a certain position.

As for the compact vs. quick release, I separated those because it is actually possible to have a quick release without having a compact one. A compact release is valuable for reasons other than its quickness, too. By having a compact release, it improves ball security throughout the throw. Defenders have less room to make a play on the ball in the quarterback's hand. so, I hope that explains why, at least in that instance, I kept it as two subtraits as opposed to just one."
"2015-05-29 18:29:14","NFL_Draft","darkforce547",3,"Yeah, that's about where I'm at. Like, touch is important. But a QB really can function without it.

I've personally been working on the Defending the Draft write-up by watching relevant games to our draft class. Since I was also sick and have had a bit of real-life drama, I only had time to revisit a couple of games:

- **Florida State vs Oklahoma State:** Mario Edwards is strong, Tyreke Hill is fast as fuck, and Ogbah and the Oklahoma State DL surprisingly manhandled a very good FSU OL. Also lol at a long Jameis Winston TD run.

- **Miami vs Louisville:** mainly watched Miami O vs Louisville D, focusing on Raiders draft picks Clive Walford and Jon Feliciano. Pretty impressed by Walford, meh at Feliciano. Sheldon Rankins had a monster day too. It was kinda nice to revisit this game, though; I had scouted it previously to watch Louisville's defensive schemes back when Grantham was rumored as a possible DC hire for us, so it was interesting to rewatch this focusing on the same plays but from another angle.

Edit: here's the game I watched today!

- **TCU vs Oklahoma St:** so this game peaked my interest in Trevon Boykin as a legit NFL prospect. I think I'm breaking this game down next. He showed a ton of skill. Doctson looked pretty awesome this game too, including an 84-yd TD where he yanked the ball away from an undercutting DB, and even though it was a blowout, I was still impressed with Ogbah. He had 2 good sacks and was all of Ok's pressure.

I also wrote up a pretty in-depth breakdown of **[Anthony Zettel vs UCF](https://www.reddit.com/r/NFL_Draft/comments/37qa1l/anthony_zettel_dt_penn_state_vs_ucf_2014_fullgame/)** for some more DL love :)"
